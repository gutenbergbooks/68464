  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In offering to the public a new edition of “Specifications for
Street Roadway Pavements” the author has taken advantage of
the opportunity to revise and expand somewhat the matter in the
original edition and to add thereto Instructions for Inspectors on
pavement work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the publication of the original pamphlet in 1907 no little
advance has been made in the design and construction of street
pavements and the framing of specifications for that work. Aside
from the personal study and efforts of individual engineers, the
Association for Standardizing Paving Specifications, organized in
the latter part of 1909, has held four important conventions, devoted
to the improvement and standardization of specifications for street
pavements, and its able standing Committees have devoted much
time and thought to the subject. The American Society of Municipal
Improvements has also devoted much attention to the subject
and has adopted standard specifications for most of the common
kinds of pavement. Other organizations have been working along
the same lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these circumstances it might be thought that there is no
longer any pressing need for the continuance of individual efforts in
this field, and it has been with some hesitation that the author has
returned to it. Without venturing to criticise the work done by
these public organizations it has seemed to the author that there is
yet room for individual work in this field, if for no other reason
than that there still remain quite divergent views not only as to
the substance, but as to the form, scope and phraseology of specifications,
and contributions based upon some knowledge and experience
in street pavement may not be without value in reaching
final conclusions.</p>

<p class='c007'>As might be expected experience and observation during the past
five years have, in a number of particulars, modified the author’s
opinions and shown where the original specifications offered might
be improved and enlarged, so that while, in the main, those now
offered follow the original text, the reader will find not a few changes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>There has also been added specifications for two comparatively new
kinds of roadway pavement that have merited attention, and for
concrete sidewalk and concrete combined curb and gutter.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as the author is aware there has not been printed, in
America at least, any complete and comprehensive code of instructions
for pavement inspectors, though there appears to be a demand,
as there certainly is a need, for something of the kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been asked about a year since to prepare such a set of
instructions for the use of one American city, the author has rewritten
parts of them in a more general form, and they are printed
(with the permission of the engineer for whom they were written)
as Part II of this edition. While they would need some revision and
modification to meet the conditions and special specification provisions
in any particular city, it is thought they may be useful in
at least suggesting the points to be covered.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART I<br /> SPECIFICATIONS FOR STREET ROADWAY PAVEMENTS</h2>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h3 class='c003'>INTRODUCTORY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In addition to their value as memoranda and aids in preparing
specifications for a particular project, carefully prepared general
specifications, embodying the latest approved practice, sometimes
supply the most useful and acceptable brief treatises upon any particular
branch of engineering work. It has been partly with this
thought in mind that the following set of specifications for standard
street pavements has been prepared and is now offered to city
engineers and municipal authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>To widen their range and increase their usefulness, copious foot
notes have been added, referring to alternative requirements and
methods of construction, and giving some of the reasons for the
preference or adoption of the construction called for in the specifications.
It is recognized that in a good many matters of detail
embraced in these specifications there is difference of opinion among
able engineers, many of whom are at least as competent as the
writer to determine what is best. They are not offered in a dogmatic
spirit, or with the hope that all the provisions found therein will be
accepted. If they shall be of some assistance in bringing about
correct standards for such specifications, their preparation will have
been justified.</p>

<p class='c007'>Theoretically, three general classes of engineering specifications
may be noted. In the first, the aim of the engineer is to specify the
end or result that it is desired to secure, leaving the contractor free
to originate and follow the methods by which these results are to be
attained. In the second the engineer aims to secure the desired
end by specifying in detail the materials and the methods which
in his opinion will accomplish the purpose, he himself assuming
responsibility for the results. Either of these two classes of specifications
is permissible, and the engineer may choose the one which
in his opinion seems best adapted to the character of the work to
be done, and the conditions under which it must be prosecuted.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the third class of specifications, met with more frequently
than they should be, the engineer undertakes to prescribe not only
the character of the materials to be used and the methods to be
pursued, but also the results to be attained. The position thus
assumed is illogical, and often unreasonable, and may lead to complications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>between the engineer and the contractor. If a contractor
be required to turn out a product which shall conform to certain
standards, he may properly be given much, if not full latitude, as
to how the stipulated results shall be secured, and may be held fully
responsible for the outcome; if on the other hand the engineer
chooses to specify with more or less minuteness the character of the
materials to be used and the methods of construction to be followed,
and enforces compliance therewith, it seems fair and just that he
should assume responsibility for the results produced, and therefore
unfair to hold the contractor to responsibility for consequences
arising from the use of materials and methods which he was allowed
no choice or latitude in selecting.</p>

<p class='c007'>In street paving work, of well-known and standard character,
the second class of specifications seems preferable for a number of
reasons, the leading one being that the time required to develop
the good or bad quality of the work must usually extend over a considerable
number of years, and the conditions to which the pavement
may be subjected in the meantime are likely to vary so widely that
it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe a satisfactory
standard of service and endurance. Disputes are therefore liable
to arise between the municipality and the contractor as to the latter’s
liability, or conditions may make it difficult or impossible to hold
the contractor to strict account for that liability.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is believed that in the present state of the art it is entirely
practicable to so frame specifications for the materials to be used
and the methods to be followed in the construction of standard street
pavements, and to so enforce compliance therewith, that the engineer
and the municipality may safely assume responsibility for the quality
of the work produced. While it may be true that local conditions
sometimes make it very difficult to enforce compliance with specifications,
the same conditions are likely to make it at least equally
difficult to secure effective responsibility on the part of the contractor
for any long-period guarantee of the work done by him;
and the contractor who negligently or purposely violates the specifications
during construction is not likely to be more faithful or
scrupulous in living up to any guarantees he may make with regard
to the future, even where the terms and conditions of such guarantees
may be clearly defined and indisputable. The writer has discussed
the subject of time guarantees as applied to street pavements
pretty fully in his book, “Municipal Public Works,” and the above
brief statement seems all that is necessary here.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>In conformity with this view of the matter, the following specifications
aim to set out as definitely and clearly as practicable the
requirements for the construction of good pavements of the several
standard kinds, and it is assumed that the engineer will be able to,
and will enforce them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, not infrequently the case that the engineer will be
called upon to prepare specifications for new, or patented, or proprietary
pavements advocated by their promoters, the value or
usefulness of which have not been sufficiently established by experience,
and for which the data for detailed, definite specifications
are not yet available.</p>

<p class='c007'>In such cases the wisest course to follow is to confine the precise
specifications to the general or standard parts of the work, while
stipulating only the <i>results to be attained</i> with regard to those features
of the work that are proprietary or questionable, thus placing upon
the promoter or his contractors full responsibility for such results
as are promised or guaranteed. This applies to new or comparatively
untried materials or processes, whether patented or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>A proposed form of general specifications to cover such cases is
offered herein.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is usually unwise to adopt or to incorporate in the municipal
specifications those prepared or offered by the promoter or patentee,
which are often brief, incomplete, and indefinite, and are sometimes
carefully, and even cunningly, drawn to evade final responsibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>No attempt has been made to submit specifications for proprietary
or patented pavements, or those composed wholly or in part of
materials which are patented or protected by trade-marks. The
owners or contractors engaged in constructing these pavements,
often, if not usually, claim the right to dictate the material parts
of the specifications under which such work shall be done, and the
municipal engineer who is called upon to construct such pavements,
must, in each case, determine whether the specifications offered are
adequate and satisfactory, and the extent to which he feels justified
in accepting responsibility for the results. Naturally, the contractor
or promoter, even if competent to prepare specifications, cannot
be expected to bind himself within closer limits than he thinks
necessary to secure the work. In many such cases the form of general
specifications for “untried or experimental pavements” given
herein might appropriately be used.</p>

<p class='c007'>The engineer is, in common with all men, fallible, and he can
hardly hope, in the preparation of specifications, to make them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>perfect; to cover every item and particular; or to escape some
ambiguities of expression, and some degree of indefiniteness. The
writer can only claim that he has aimed, in the light of a considerable
experience, to set out as fully and definitely as practicable
the requirements for the proper construction of high-class street
pavements, and has endeavored to avoid loose or obscure terms and
expressions. The ideal specification is one that furnishes a wholly
sufficient guide to the accomplishment of the desired purpose; that
provides for every possible contingency which may arise, and is
couched in language which not only means exactly what it was
intended to mean, but is incapable of any other interpretation. It
is needless to say that no example of such a perfect specification
can be instanced as a model.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been the aim to make these specifications fair and just
to the contractor; that is, to require of him no impracticable or
indefinite service, or the assumption by him of risks other than those
fairly involved in the business conduct of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the plans and specifications for any work which a contractor
bids upon are so full, specific, and clear, that he may know exactly
what he will be expected to do, and if they do not require him to
assume unusual chances and risks, he may intelligently name prices
which he believes will compensate him for the service. Having
done so, his proposal having been accepted, and a contract entered
into accordingly, the engineer and the municipality have a right
both in law and equity to demand that he will do exactly and fully
what he has contracted to do. No excuses on his part can be valid
and none should be accepted. He may in all fairness and justness
be required to “toe the mark” strictly. To the neglect to recognize
and enforce these principles is chargeable the greater part of the
poor and unsatisfactory work so common in street pavement work
in our cities. Unexpected contingencies may, of course, arise where
some changes and concessions may be proper and just, but these
should be, and usually are, very rare. On the other hand, sweeping
general clauses in contracts and specifications intended to catch the
contractor “goin’ or comin’,” unnecessarily stringent stipulations
which were never intended to be strictly enforced, but were put into
the specifications with the idea that they would help hold the contractor
up to a high standard, and “one-sided” contracts intended
to give the municipality an unfair advantage over the contractor,
are as inadvisable in policy as they are wrong in principle. Nothing
should be put in a specification that is not clearly essential to secure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the results aimed at, and, this having been done, every requirement
should be enforced. The existence in specifications of requirements
that are not intended to be enforced, gives the contractor a pretext
for neglecting others that may be important.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these specifications will be found a number of details that
are often not regarded as important and which, when found in paving
specifications, the contractor is frequently allowed to ignore.
In the writer’s opinion, based upon his experience in street paving,
every one of these requirements is essential to the production of
high-class work, which, it is hardly necessary to argue, is, in the end,
the most economical work from the standpoint of the municipality.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be argued that the adoption and enforcement of these
specifications would have the effect of raising prices. In many cases
this would doubtless prove true. Contractors are entitled to a fair
and reasonable compensation for their services. It is admitted that
in some cities the prevailing prices for some kinds of pavements
are below the actual cost of the work if it were done in a proper
manner, conforming strictly to the specifications. Illogical as it
undoubtedly is, the low price at which work is taken is sometimes
considered a sufficient reason for accepting work below standard.
The consequence is that bidders not only count upon concessions
and lax enforcement of the specifications, but bid lower and lower,
expecting that further concessions will enable them to get out with
an undeserved profit. This is one of the most serious evils in the
paving business to-day, and the highest public interests demand a
thorough reform. Low first cost, desirable as it may be, is the
poorest economy if it be secured at the sacrifice of the quality of the
work. If one pavement costs twenty per cent. more than another,
but renders forty per cent. more service, it is obviously the cheaper
of the two.</p>

<p class='c007'>Contractors are prone to contend that this or that provision
in a specification is unusual, unnecessary or unfair. In dealing with
them the engineer should bear in mind that no requirement of a
specification that is clearly and definitely stated, so that the bidder
may understand exactly what it means and what he will be expected
to do, and may frame his prices accordingly, can be unreasonable
or unfair to the contractor. Unusual or unnecessary requirements
may result in unwarrantably increasing the cost of the work, and
this may raise a question between the engineer and the municipality
employing him, but it can furnish no occasion for questions of fairness
or unfairness between the contractor and the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The relations that should exist between the contractee and the
contractor, and the attitude of the engineer toward the contractor
have been widely discussed and are quite well understood from both
the ethical and legal standpoint.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to bear in mind that when a contract is duly entered
into, both the parties thereto are equal before the law. Neither can
impose upon the other terms or conditions that are not clearly included
in or to be fairly inferred from the contract itself. The
assumption that either party has superior or extra rights not expressed
or to be fairly inferred from the written agreement, or in
accordance with the established rulings of the courts, is wholly
without warrant. The smallest contractor is, in this respect, upon
an equal footing with the largest city government for which he may
undertake to do contract work. It is not infrequently the case that
the city assumes a superior and dictatorial attitude not in harmony
with these principles, and it is too common for the contractor to seek
to evade or to escape from clear contractural obligations. In neither
case is the action warranted by fairness, justice, or law.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be needless to say that the attitude of the engineer
toward the contractor should be one of unyielding and uncompromising
requirement that the contract and specifications shall be
fully and faithfully complied with, but at the same time one of
absolute fairness and even helpfulness to the contractor. The ideal
relation, which should be more commonly attainable than it appears
to be, is that of helpful cooperation to bring about the results the
contract and specifications were intended to secure.</p>

<p class='c007'>In line with the principles here outlined some observations upon
the preparation of contracts and specifications are appropriate.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the general practice to include in and make a part of “The
Contract” (herein for convenience called The General Contract)
all the various documents that are supposed to relate directly to
the transaction as a whole. The separate parts of such a general
contract may vary in number or character, but the principal ones
are the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The advertisement for proposals.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Instructions to bidders.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The proposal submitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The contract proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of these should be drawn to cover fully and clearly its
appropriate purpose or function but <i>nothing more</i>. It is not unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to find, even in the instructions to bidders, stipulations that properly
belong in the contract or specifications, and it is quite common to
find in the contract proper a lot of matter that properly belongs in
the specifications only. In such cases there is liable to be more or
less confusion as to the actual meaning or requirements of the
general contract as a whole, which may lead to serious misunderstandings
and complications between the parties thereto. The
several documents composing the general contract are likely to be
prepared by different persons, looking at the transaction from
different points of view, and often not wholly familiar with the scope,
intent and language of the other documents. There is therefore
a possibility, at least, of indefinite, if not of conflicting expressions
which are open to different interpretations, particularly in the
light of special or unexpected conditions that may arise during the
progress of the work or the settlement therefor. It would tend to
eliminate or avoid the possibility of such complications if each of
the several documents confined itself strictly to its appropriate
function in the general contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>Advertisements for proposals may be divided into two general
classes. The one is brief in form and substance, simply stating
that proposals for a certain named work will be received at a stated
place and time, and referring those interested to documents on file
at a stated place for all further information. This is the general
form adopted by the United States War Department for the many
projects carried out by contract under its direction. A sample
advertisement taken from a current technical journal is as follows;</p>

<p class='c012'>TREASURY DEPARTMENT, OFFICE OF
the Supervising Architect, Washington, D. C.,
October 10, 1912. Sealed Proposals will be received
at this office until 3 o’clock p. m. on the 1st day of
November, 1912, and then opened, for an electric
passenger elevator in the United States post office,
Bellingham, Wash., in accordance with the drawing
and specification, copies of which may be had at this
office at the discretion of the Supervising Architect.
OSCAR WENDEROTH, Supervising Architect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other general class of advertisement, very commonly used
by municipal corporations, is much longer and more elaborate,
giving a condensed statement of the character of the work to be
done, the conditions under which proposals are invited and will be
received, and a schedule of the quantities of work involved, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>with other particulars. A typical example of such an advertisement,
taken from the same periodical, is here given:</p>

Five Thousand ($5,000) Dollars in money or a certified
check for the same amount on some responsible
bank located and doing business in the City of Chicago
and made payable to the order of the Commissioner
of Public Works.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Commissioner of Public Works reserves the
right to reject any or all bids. A deposit of One

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Such advertisements as this may be required by statutes or ordinances,
and in that case are, of course, proper and necessary. Even
where not so required they may be considered advantageous, because
they give prospective bidders more complete information as
to the character and magnitude of the work, and may enable them
to decide at once whether they care to pursue the matter further.
But on the whole, the shorter form of advertisement, if permissible,
seems preferable, because it refers the enquirer directly to the original
and official sources of information, the forms to be used, the contract,
specifications and estimated quantities of work, exactly as
they will and must be presented to all bidders, and as they will appear
in the subsequent stages of the transaction, and leaves, therefore,
no room for possible confusion of statements between the
advertisement and the other documents. Furthermore, the cost
of the shorter form of advertisement is much less, and this is often
a matter of some importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instructions to bidders should be confined strictly to such information
and directions as the bidder may need to properly and
intelligently make up and submit his proposal in accordance with
the requirements relating thereto. This should include primarily,
a reference to the contract and specifications for all general and detailed
information about the work to be done, but should carefully
avoid any statements or language that might be construed to add
to, take from, limit or modify the contract or specifications. Perhaps
the briefest and best statement of what this document should
or should not contain is that it should be so framed that, except as
a matter of record, its office and usefulness should absolutely end
with the award and signing of the contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one who is not a lawyer can presume to say just what the contract
proper should contain or cover, particularly as this may vary
with the requirements of statutes and ordinances in force in a given
city. It would seem logical and proper, however, to separate the
special functions of contracts and specifications in such a way that
each should cover a distinct field of its own, and be free from encroachment
upon the proper domain of the other. With such a
conception of the proper domain of each, one might safely say that
the contract should undertake to set out only the legal and contractural
relations of the parties thereto, and should refer to the
plans and specifications for all detailed instructions as to the actual
performance of the work and the results to be secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the preparation of specifications for any public work the main
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>points to be kept in mind are fulness, definiteness, and exact expression.
While brevity and conciseness are desirable qualities
in any document, they should not be secured at the expense of completeness
and precision of statement. Even the frequent repetition
of words, phrases and sentences throughout a document, where
it is necessary to avoid the possibility of misunderstanding or ambiguity,
should be resorted to freely. Exact description and definition
are more important than literary style, though they may often
be successfully combined. Of course, it is not possible or necessary
to go into minute detail with regard to every part of the work.
Certain things may be safely assumed to be required by established
practice or trade usage. If, for instance, it is specified that certain
lumber shall be “dressed” this word has a well-understood meaning
in the trade and it is unnecessary to stipulate how the dressing shall
be done or its character or quality, though it may be necessary to
say whether it is to be dressed on one or more sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proper preparation of specifications for any work involves
a clear, distinct and complete conception, determination and design
of what is to be done; of the conditions that are likely to be met with
in carrying it out; and of alternate plans that these conditions may
necessitate. This may not always be possible, for the engineer is
not omniscient. But careful study and maturity of design will
enable him to avoid the great majority of such indefinite expressions
as “or in such other manner as the engineer may direct,” “in
accordance with the instructions of the engineer,” etc. A great
many of the items to which such expressions are intended to and
do apply in practice, could be definitely settled before the specifications
are prepared and thus all uncertainty on the part of both engineer
and contractor be avoided. To illustrate: specifications for
block pavement commonly stipulate that the blocks shall be set
in rows running at right angles to the axis of the street, except at
street intersections, where the engineer may direct them to be laid
at a different angle. There is usually no good reason why the engineer
should not determine beforehand at which, if any, street intersections
the general rule should be changed and so state in the specifications.
These may be and usually are unimportant matters which
may not much affect one way or the other the cost to the contractor.
But they often prove otherwise, and the contractor is entitled to
know when he submits his proposal just what he will be required to
do. Of course it may develop during the progress of the work that
changes from the original plan will become necessary, but these should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>be provided for in some such definite and previously stipulated
manner as outlined in Sect. 3 of the following specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of inserting, either in the specifications or the contract,
a clause making the engineer judge and arbiter in any differences
that may arise between the city and the contractor, and providing
that his decision in all such cases shall be final, is as unwise
as it is often illegal. Such clauses are based on the assumption that
the engineer is a competent as well as a disinterested party in the
transaction, an assumption that is usually wholly wrong, though to
their honor it may be said that the confidence thus reposed in engineers
is seldom abused. But the fact is that the engineer is
never actually a disinterested party. He is employed and paid by
the city to look after its interests, and is under no obligations to the
contractor other than those named in the contract and specifications
and his sense of justice, propriety and professional honor. He
would be recreant to his duty if in all nicely balanced matters of
doubt he did not espouse the side of his employer. Moreover, his
personal interests are often involved. Having prepared the plans,
specifications and estimates for the work, he is naturally and properly
anxious that it shall be successful and that the cost shall not exceed
that estimated. Under all these conditions it is hardly possible
for any human being to be a wholly disinterested and unprejudiced
judge. No broad-minded and conscientious engineer desires to
be placed in such a difficult position, and it is as unfair as it is unwise
and improper to require him to assume it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are, however, a number of matters of fact in reference to
which it is proper and necessary to make the judgment and decision
of the engineer controlling and final, unless it may be shown that
his decision is clearly erroneous or affected by improper motives,
or by fraud. Some one must necessarily be made the immediate
and final judge as to whether the quality of materials and workmanship
is in accordance with the requirements of the plans and
specifications, and as to the quantity of work actually performed,
and these duties and responsibilities are very properly placed upon
the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It not infrequently occurs that specifications are not drawn as
clearly as they should be in the matters of methods of measuring
the work and of applying contract unit prices, and indefiniteness
and carelessness in this regard are often a source of misunderstanding
and dispute between the engineer and the contractor. It is a
good practice, followed by many able engineers, after specifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>how a certain part of the work shall be done, to state how it shall
be measured and paid for at the contract unit prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many respects it is desirable that all the work to be done under
contract should be quite fully itemized, and a unit price named for
each kind of work. It is the custom in many cities to name only
certain leading items of the work to be done under a paving contract,
as for the pavement complete, furnishing and setting new
curbing, redressing and resetting old curbing, and possibly a few
other leading items, and to require that all necessary incidental
work shall be done by the contractor without cost to the city; or, in
other words, he must take this possible extra work into consideration
in naming his unit prices for the leading items of the work.
As the quantity of this incidental work is often not stated, and the
contractor has no means of ascertaining it, he must guess, as intelligently
as he may be able, how much he should add to his unit prices
to cover its cost. If he is a prudent contractor he will be sure to
add enough to prevent any possible loss on this account. In most
cases the quantities of this incidental work can be determined and
scheduled by the engineer with the more important items, and the
contractor may be required to name unit prices for it. True, there
are likely to develop during the progress of the work some items
that could not be foreseen or that were overlooked. In some cities
such contingencies are provided for by a clause in the contract or
specifications scheduling, by name, all the incidental minor items
of work that experience has shown are likely to be met with in street paving
contracts, and naming fair unit prices which the contractor
will be paid for each, should it occur. The contractor may then
feel assured that however much the quantity of such incidental
work may vary, he will receive compensation proportionate thereto,
and he may name his prices for the main items with more confidence.
Under such conditions it is reasonable to expect closer figures than
he would be willing to name if an unknown quantity of incidental
work for which no separate pay is provided had to be taken into
consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sub-division of unit prices is also desirable in order that the engineer
may be able to analyze and record the elements that make up
the aggregate cost of the work. Thus, in the case of the construction
of a new sheet asphalt pavement it is common to ask for a single
price for the pavement complete, including a five year guarantee.
Now the work will consist of several distinct operations or kinds
of work for each of which a separate price might be named:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>1. The grading of the street and preparation of the sub-grade.
The quantity of this work will vary on different streets and is best
reckoned by the cubic yard of material excavated.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A price, either per cubic yard or per square yard for the concrete
foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A price per square yard for the asphalt pavement proper. This
might, if desired, be sub-divided into separate prices for the base-course and the surface-course.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. A price per square yard for guaranteeing the pavement for
five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such sub-division would, it is true, increase the work of final computation
but if of no other value, the detailed costs would be a great
aid to the engineer in estimating the reasonable cost of future work
where the relative quantity of these detailed parts varied.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK</h4>

<p class='c015'>The work embraced in and to be done under this contract consists
of grading the entire street from curb to curb between the
limits named, including the removal or readjustment of the pavement
now on the roadway, setting and resetting curbing, laying
or relaying sidewalks where required, furnishing all new material
and performing all the labor required for paving the roadway,
together with all incidental work necessary to complete the whole
in a proper manner, in accordance with the contract, the plans on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>file in the office of the City Engineer, these Specifications and the
instructions of the City Engineer, herein referred to as the Engineer,
or his authorized agents.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>REFERENCES</h4>

<p class='c015'>The numbered divisions of these specifications are herein designated
as “sections,” each being referred to by the number standing
at its beginning. Where reference is herein made to any such section
number it shall be considered equivalent to a quotation of that
section.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plans and drawings relating to this work, on file in the
office of the City Engineer are designated as&#160;...</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>1. Authority.</strong>—Wherever, in these specifications, the words, the
City, are used, they shall be understood to refer to the duly constituted
municipal government of the city of&#160;...
or its authorized agents, acting within the authority specifically conferred
upon them by the said municipal government.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Wherever, in these specifications, the words, the Engineer, shall
be used, they shall be understood to refer to the City Engineer
of said city, or his deputies or assistants, acting within the authority
conferred upon them by the City Engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no agent of the city shall have power to revoke, alter, enlarge
or relax the stipulations or requirements of these specifications,
except in so far as such authority may be specifically conferred in
or by the specifications themselves, without the formal authorization
so to do, conferred by the contract of which these specifications
are a part, or by ordinance, resolution or other usual official action
of the city.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>2. Interpretation.</strong>—In case of any actual or alleged disagreement
or discrepancy between the contract, these specifications, and the
plans for the work on file in the office of the Engineer, the language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>and provisions of the contract shall take precedence and prevail;
and the Engineer shall determine in each case whether the specifications
or the plans shall be followed.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>3.</strong> The Engineer shall have the right to make such changes in the
plans and specifications of the work as he may deem necessary or
desirable or to provide for unexpected conditions or contingencies
that may develop at any time after the signing of the contract, or
during the progress, or before the final acceptance of the work;
provided that all such changes do not involve an aggregate increase
or decrease in the cost of the work, as shown by his estimates, of
more than ten (10) per cent. The contractor shall accept such
changes when made, as a part of the original contract and specifications,
subject to all the provisions and conditions thereof. But
before any such changes shall become valid and before the contractor
shall begin the particular work involved in such changes, the
increased or decreased cost of the work by reason of such changes,
above or below what it would have been under the original plans
and specifications, shall be agreed upon in writing between the
engineer and the contractor. And when the whole work, including
such changes, shall have been completed and accepted by the
engineer, the sum or sums so agreed upon shall be added to or
deducted from the sum that would have been due the contractor
if no such changes had been made.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>4. Quality of Material and Work.</strong>—The judgment and decision
of the Engineer as to whether the materials supplied and the work
done under this contract comply with the requirements of these
specifications, shall be conclusive and final. No material shall be
used in the work until it has been examined and approved by the
Engineer, or his authorized agents. All rejected material must be
promptly removed from the work and replaced with that which is
acceptable to the Engineer, and all improper or defective work must
be corrected, and, if necessary, removed and reconstructed so as to
comply with these specifications and the instructions of the Engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all matters of detail not specifically covered by the specifications
the work shall be well and skillfully done in accordance with
the best trade or art customs and standards for work of like character
and purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>5. Inspection.</strong>—The Engineer may provide for the inspection, by
assistants and inspectors under his direction, of all materials used
and all work done under this contract. Such inspection may extend
to all or any part of the work, and to the preparation or manufacture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of materials to be used, whether within the limits of the work on the
street, or at any other place. The Engineer and his inspectors shall
have free access to all parts of the work, including mines, quarries,
manufactories, or other places where any part of the materials to be
used is procured, manufactured or prepared. The Contractor shall
furnish the Engineer all information relating to the work and the
material therefor which the Engineer may deem necessary or pertinent,
and with such samples of materials as may be required. The
Contractor shall, at his expense, supply inspectors with such labor
and assistance as may be necessary in the handling of materials
for proper inspection. Inspectors shall have authority to reject
defective material and to suspend any work that is being improperly
done, subject to the final decision of the Engineer. Inspectors shall
have no authority to permit deviations from, or to relax any of the
provisions of these specifications without the written permission or
instruction of the Engineer; nor to delay the Contractor by failure
to inspect materials and work with reasonable promptness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The payment of any compensation, whatever may be its character
or form, or the giving of any gratuity, or the granting of any
valuable favor, by the Contractor to any inspector, directly or
indirectly, is strictly prohibited, and any such act on the part of
the Contractor will constitute a violation of these specifications.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>6. Injuries to Persons and Property.</strong>—The Contractor shall be
held alone responsible for all injuries to persons, and for all damages
to the property of the city or others, caused by or resulting from the
negligence of himself, his employees or agents, during the progress
of, or connected with the prosecution of the work, whether within
the limits of the work, or elsewhere. He must restore all injured
property, including sidewalks, curbing, sodding, pipes, conduits,
sewers and other public or private property to a condition as good
as it was when he entered upon the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>7. Sanitary Conveniences; Nuisances.</strong>—The Contractor shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>provide all necessary privy accommodations for the use of his employees
on the street, and shall maintain the same in a clean and
sanitary condition. He shall not create nor permit any nuisance
to the public or to residents in the vicinity of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>8. Public Convenience.</strong>—No material, or other obstruction
shall be placed within five feet of fire hydrants, which must be at
all times readily accessible to the Fire Department.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the progress of the work the convenience of the public
and of the residents along the street must be provided for as far as
practicable. Convenient access to driveways, houses and buildings
along the street must be maintained wherever possible. Temporary
approaches to and crossings of intersecting streets and sidewalks
must be provided and kept in good condition, wherever
practicable.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>9. Barriers, Lights, Watchmen.</strong>—The Contractor shall provide
and maintain such fences, barriers, “street closed” signs, red lights,
and watchmen as may be necessary to prevent avoidable accidents
to residents and to the public.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>10. Disorderly Employees.</strong>—Disorderly, intemperate, or incompetent
persons must not be employed, retained, or allowed upon
the work. Foremen or workmen who neglect or refuse to comply
with the instructions of the Engineer, shall, at his request, be
promptly discharged, and shall not thereafter be re-employed
without his consent.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>11. Order and Progress of Doing Work.</strong>—The work under this contract
shall be prosecuted at as many different points, at such times,
and in such sections along the line of the work, and with such forces
as the Engineer may from time to time deem necessary, and direct,
to secure its completion within the contract time. Not more than
one thousand (1,000) linear feet of the street shall be torn up, obstructed
or closed to travel at any one time without the written permission
of the Engineer. Completed portions of the pavement
shall be opened to travel as directed by the Engineer, but such
opening shall not be construed as an acceptance by the City of the
work done. Where thus opened to public travel by the direction
of the Engineer, the Contractor will not be held responsible for injuries
to the work caused by such travel or public use, pending the
final completion and acceptance of the whole work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>12. Grade and Contour of Pavement.</strong>—Roadway pavements
shall be laid to such grades, crown and contour of surface as the plans
may show or the Engineer may direct, and the surface of the completed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>pavement shall conform accurately to such grades, crown
and contour. The designed surface of the completed pavement
shall be considered as the datum or plane of reference in fixing the
location or level of the sub-grade, of the pavement foundation, and
of structures connected therewith. It will be hereafter referred to
in these specifications as “The pavement datum.”</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>13. City Monuments or Stakes.</strong>—The Contractor must carefully
protect from disturbance or injury all city monuments, stakes and
benchmarks, and shall not excavate nearer than five feet to any of
them without the permission of the Engineer; or until they have
been removed, witnessed, or otherwise disposed of by the Engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>14. Old Material.</strong>—All material or structures removed from the
street and not required for the new construction, but which the city
may desire to reserve, shall be delivered and neatly piled up in a
corporation yard or elsewhere, by the Contractor, as the Engineer
may direct. Such reserved material shall be considered in the
custody of the Contractor until delivered at the place designated,
and he will be held responsible for its care and protection, and must
make good any losses occasioned by damage, theft, or misappropriation
while it is on the street or en route to the place of storage.
If the Contractor shall be required to haul such reserved material
more than one-half mile, he shall be paid a reasonable price, to be
agreed upon in advance, for the haul exceeding that distance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Material taken from the work which is to be used in the new construction
shall be compactly piled where it will least obstruct the
sidewalks or adjoining sections of the street, and properly protected
by the Contractor until it is required for use.</p>

<p class='c007'>All old material removed from the work, including the material
excavated in preparing the sub-grade, not reserved by the City nor
to be used again in the work, shall belong to the Contractor and
must be removed by him from the street as promptly as possible.
It must not be placed on the sidewalks or adjacent streets, nor on
any other street or property belonging to the City, nor on the property
of private owners, without the written consent of the Engineer,
or the owner of the property.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>15. Storage of New Material.</strong>—The material for construction
when brought upon the street shall be neatly piled so as to cause as
little obstruction to travel as possible, and so that it may be
conveniently inspected.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>16. Rebuilding and Adjusting Street Structures.</strong>—Catch basins,
manhole, sewer and water frames and covers, sewer inlets, water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>pipes and other conduits, belonging to the City and within the limits
of the work, shall, if necessary, be reset to the new lines and grades
of the street and for this purpose good brick masonry of the original
thickness, laid in Portland cement mortar shall be used. Great
care must be taken to set all such structures as project through
the pavement exactly to the grade and contour of the new street
surface, and any defects in the conformity of such structures to
the pavement datum, discovered at the time, or during the progress
of the work, or during the guaranty period, stipulated in Sec. 25
shall be promptly remedied by the Contractor.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>17. Clean Sidewalks.</strong>—During the progress of the work, the
sidewalks and portions of the street adjoining the work, or in its
vicinity, must not be obstructed or littered more than may be absolutely
necessary, and the adjacent sidewalks must be kept clean.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>18. Connection With Existing Pavements or Streets.</strong>—Wherever
a new pavement joins or abuts against an existing pavement of a
different kind, or an unpaved street, either at the end of the new
pavement or at cross or intersecting streets, a line of stone headers
shall be provided and set. The stone shall be of sound, hard limestone,
sandstone, granite or bluestone, free from injurious imperfections.
The separate stones shall be not less than three (3) feet
long, at least eighteen (18) inches deep, not less than four and one-half
(4½) inches wide at the top, nor less than three (3) inches
wide at the bottom. The top shall be of uniform width for each
line of headers, and shall be dressed square and even. The ends
shall be dressed to secure a joint not wider than one-half (½) inch
for a depth of six inches from the top, and the sides dressed so as to
secure good contact and close jointing with the pavement. The
stones shall be set accurately with their tops at the pavement datum,
on a bed of concrete nine (9) inches wide and six (6) inches deep,
and after being set the trench shall be filled and rammed full of
gravel or crushed stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>All existing pavements adjoining or abutting against the new
pavement, with their crosswalks, curbs, and gutters, shall be adjusted,
or taken up and relaid, to conform to and connect with the
pavement datum, to such an extent as the Engineer may direct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the new and adjoining pavement are of the same kind,
and headers are not used, the new and the old pavement must be
properly joined and connected, as the Engineer may direct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stone headers will be paid for by the linear foot at the contract
price for that item, and the other work embraced in this section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>will be paid for at the contract prices for the several items, where
such contract prices are provided; otherwise the work shall be considered
as incidental work and shall be done at the expense of the
Contractor.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>19. Curbing to be Completed in Advance.</strong>—The setting of all
new curbing and guttering and the redressing, resetting or readjustment
of all old curbing must be completed at least 100 feet in advance
of the construction of the street foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>20. Final Cleaning Up.</strong>—Immediately after the completion of
the work or any consecutive portion of it, the Contractor shall remove
from it all unused material, refuse and dirt placed by him
on, or in the vicinity of the work, or resulting from its prosecution,
and restore the street to a condition as clean as before the work was
begun; and the new pavement shall be properly cleaned.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>21. Measurements and Computations.</strong>—Unless otherwise distinctly
provided in the contract and specifications, measurements,
computations and payments will be based upon the actual quantities
of completed work, customary or conventional methods of measurement
and computation to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>The area of street pavement shall be reckoned in square yards
of completed pavement surface, deducting manholes, inlets and other
openings in the surface of the pavement having an area of over
three (3) square feet. Unless separately paid for under the contract,
stone headers and crosswalks will be measured as a part of the
pavement surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>22.</strong> The price for the pavement per square yard shall, unless
otherwise stated herein, include the preparation of the sub-foundation,
the construction of the foundation, the cushion course, and
the pavement complete, including all the materials and labor required
therefor.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>23. Incidental Work at Contractor’s Expense.</strong>—All the work to be
done by the Contractor for which specific unit prices are not named
in the contract, specified and enumerated in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, as well as any minor details
of work not specifically mentioned in the specifications, but obviously
necessary for the proper completion of the work, shall be considered
as incidental, and as being a part of and included with the work
for which prices are named in the contract. The Contractor will
not be entitled to any extra or additional compensation therefor.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>24. Extra Work.</strong>—The City may require the Contractor to
furnish such additional materials and to do such additional work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>not provided for in the contract and these specifications, but which
may be found necessary or pertinent to the proper prosecution and
completion of the work embraced in the contract, at prices to be
agreed upon in writing, in advance. But no work other than that
included in the contract and these specifications and which is covered
by and to be paid for at the prices named in the contract, shall be
done by the Contractor except upon a written order from the Engineer,
which order shall describe the work to be done and name
the compensation agreed upon therefor. In the absence of such
written order from the Engineer the Contractor will not be entitled
to payment for any such additional or extra work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same manner the city may omit or dispense with items or
parts of the work, by previous agreement with the contractor, and
a like written order by the engineer. But such additions, omissions
or alterations shall not together increase or decrease the aggregate
cost of the whole work more than fifteen per cent. (15%). Any
changes in the plans, specifications, character of material used or
method of doing the work that may increase or decrease the aggregate
cost of the work more than fifteen per cent. (15%) may be
authorized and validated only by a formal, supplemental contract,
regularly executed by all the parties to the original contract.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>25. Guaranty.</strong><a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a>—The Contractor shall guarantee that all the materials
used and all the work done under this contract shall fully
comply with the requirements of these specifications, the plans
herein before referred to and the instructions of the Engineer. Any
defects in the completed work, or any part of it, or any failure of the
work to fully perform or endure the service for which it was intended,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>which, in the opinion of the Engineer, are attributable to the use
of materials, skill, or workmanship not in compliance with the said
specifications, plans and instructions, within a period of&#160;...
years after the date of the certificate of completion and
acceptance, shall be regarded as prima facie and conclusive evidence
that the Contractor has failed to comply with the said specifications,
plans and instructions. And the Contractor shall, at his own expense,
at such time and in such manner as the Engineer may direct,
repair or take up and reconstruct any such defective work, in full
compliance with the original specifications, plans and instructions.
And as surety for the performance of this guaranty the Contractor’s
bond, required by the contract, shall remain in full force until the
expiration of the period of&#160;... years above stipulated
in this section.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>PREPARING THE SUB-GRADE</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>26. Grading.</strong>—The whole area to be occupied by the pavement
and its foundation shall be excavated or filled up to a sub-grade at
such an elevation that after being compacted by the roller, the
surface will be&#160;... inches below the pavement datum, and truly
parallel thereto. In excavating, the earth must not be disturbed
below the sub-grade. Plowing will not be permitted where the depth
of earth to be removed is less than five (5) inches, and in no case must
the plow be allowed to penetrate to within less than one inch of the
sub-grade. Places that are found to be loose, or soft, or composed
of unsuitable material, below sub-grade, must be dug out and refilled
with sand, or other material as good as the average of that found on
the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the natural surface of the ground shall be below the sub-grade,
or shall become so by the removal of old pavement or other
structures, it must be filled to the sub-grade in layers not exceeding
five inches in depth, and each layer shall be thoroughly rolled or
rammed before the next layer is placed upon it, and when the filling
is completed the filled area must be properly trimmed and compacted
by rolling or ramming to the true sub-grade, as in excavation.
The material excavated from the street may be used for such filling,
provided it be of suitable quality. Where it cannot be thus procured
from the street it must be obtained by the Contractor elsewhere, in
which case the actual quantity so obtained, measured after it is compacted
in the street, will be paid for at the contract price for “earth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>filling.” The price bid for “earth excavation” will be paid for all
material excavated above the sub-grade, measured in place on the
street, which price includes the cost of disposing of the excavated
material, whether as waste or filling, and of trimming and rolling
or ramming the sub-grade, and of making it ready for the pavement
foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the excavation is completed and the surface neatly trimmed,
the whole area shall be well compacted by rolling with a roller weighing
not less than five tons. Areas inaccessible to the roller shall
be rammed until they are as well compacted as the rolled surface.
When the rolling is completed the surface must be nowhere more
than three-fourths inch below, nor more than three-eighths inch
above the true sub-grade. If, after the rolling is completed and
before the pavement foundation is laid, the surface shall become
disturbed in any way, it must be replaced and properly compacted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the soil composing the sub-foundation is found to be wet
or “springy,” a system of soft tile drains, discharging into the street
drainage system, shall be constructed by the Contractor, as directed
by the Engineer. The tile shall be laid in trenches about one foot
wide and from one to two feet deep. After the tile is in place the
trenches shall be filled with crushed stone or gravel, well compacted
by tamping. The tile will be paid for per linear foot at the contract
price for the same, which price shall include the cost of excavating
and refilling the trenches with crushed stone.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>PAVEMENT FOUNDATION</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>27.</strong> Pavement foundation shall consist of hydraulic concrete,
or of old pavement stone relaid, or of broken stone or gravel, as
may be herein specified, constructed upon the sub-grade.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c014'>HYDRAULIC CONCRETE FOUNDATION</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'><strong>28. Concrete.</strong>—Concrete shall be composed of Portland cement,
sand, broken stone and water.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>29. Portland Cement.</strong><a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a>—Portland cement shall be defined as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>pulverized product resulting from the calcination to incipient fusion
of an intimate mixture of properly proportioned argillaceous and
calcareous materials, and to which no addition greater than three
per cent. has been made subsequent to calcination.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Specific Gravity.</strong>—The specific gravity of the dry cement at a
temperature of two hundred and twelve (212) degrees F. shall not
be less than 3.10.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Fineness.</strong>—It shall be pulverized to such fineness that not more
than eight (8) per cent. shall fail to pass a number one hundred
(100) sieve and not more than twenty-five (25) per cent. shall fail
to pass a number two hundred (200) sieve.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Time of Setting.</strong>—At the temperature of sixty (60) degrees F.
mortar made of neat cement shall not begin to set in less than thirty
(30) minutes, nor set hard in less than one hour, but must set hard
within ten (10) hours.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Strength.</strong>—When thoroughly mixed dry with clean, sharp, moderately
coarse sand, in the ratio by weight of one part cement to
three parts of sand, and then made into stiff mortar, briquets
made from this mortar and exposed for one day to moist air and
immersed in water for the balance of the periods named below,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>shall develop a tensile strength per square inch not less than the

    <td class='c009'>In twenty-eight days</td>
    <td class='c017'>250 pounds.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c007'><strong>Constancy of Volume.</strong>—When subjected to standard tests for
constancy of volume, the cement shall show no tendency to swell
or crack.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Composition.</strong>—The cement shall not contain more than one and
three-fourths (1.75) per cent. of anhydrous sulphuric acid, nor more
than four (4) per cent. of magnesia.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Tests.</strong>—Cement tests shall be conducted in accordance with the
methods recommended by the “Committee on Uniform Tests of
Cement” of the American Society of Civil Engineers.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Conditions.</strong>—All cement shall be supplied in original packages
with the brand of the manufacturer marked on each package. It
shall be protected during transportation from rain and moisture.
It shall be delivered upon the work at least ten (10) days (exclusive
of Sundays and holidays) before it is to be used, in order to
allow of proper inspection, and the contractor shall furnish all
necessary facilities for such inspection. Brands of cement without
established good reputation, or not heretofore used in the City of&#160;... may be rejected; or they will be accepted
only after they satisfactorily pass the 28–day test. Rejected cement
must be at once removed from the street.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>30. Sand.</strong>—Sand for concrete shall be composed of grains not
softer than hard limestone. It shall be moderately coarse and
preferably made up of grains of varying size producing a mass with
low percentage of voids. It shall not contain, in all, more than
seven (7) per cent. by volume of clay, loam, mica scales, silt, or other
objectionable inorganic matter, nor more than one (1) per cent. of
organic matter.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>31. Broken Stone.</strong>—Broken stone for concrete shall be of hard and
sound limestone or other stone equally hard and durable, broken to
a roughly cubical form. It shall be screened through efficient
revolving screens, and only such fragments as have passed through
circular screen openings two and one-half (2½) inches in diameter,
shall be used. If the crushed dust and fine fragments be not
screened out, the stone must be so handled that the fine material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>will be evenly distributed through the mass when it reaches the
concrete platform or mixer.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>32. Water.</strong>—Water used for concrete shall be fresh, and reasonably
clean.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>33. Care and Handling of Concrete Material.</strong>—Cement must
not be allowed to become wet or damp. It shall be stored until
used, whether in storehouses or on the street, so that no part of the
packages shall be nearer than four (4) inches to the ground or pavement,
and shall be effectually covered so that rain cannot reach it.
Sand and stone, if stored on the street, shall be on lumber floors.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
The stone shall be thoroughly wetted a sufficient time before being
placed in the concrete to allow any surplus water to drain away,
but shall remain moist where it reaches the concrete platform or
mixer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>34. Ratio of Concrete Materials.</strong>—Concrete will be composed of
one part Portland cement,&#160;... parts of sand and&#160;... parts of broken stone, and the proper quantity
of water, all measured by volume.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> The unit of measurement shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>be the barrel of cement which shall be considered as containing four
(4) cubic feet. The materials shall each be measured in such manner
and with such accuracy that the quantities used will not vary more
than seven (7) per cent. from the quantities required in the ratio
named above for each batch of concrete.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>35. Mixing Concrete.</strong>—If mixed by hand, concrete shall be mixed
on platforms of iron or wood of sufficient size to admit of proper
manipulation of the concrete. The sand shall be first spread evenly
over the platform and the cement evenly distributed over the sand.
These two materials shall then be mixed dry until a uniform and
homogeneous mixture is secured. Sufficient water shall then be
added and the mixing resumed and continued until a mortar of
uniform consistency and texture is produced and distributed in an
even layer over the platform. The stone shall then be distributed
over the mortar and mixed therewith until the mortar is evenly
distributed through the mass and every fragment of stone is well
coated with mortar, sufficient additional water being added as
the mixing progresses to produce a rather wet, but not sloppy,
concrete.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Machine mixing of concrete will be preferred, provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the machine used secures equal accuracy in the ratios of materials
and equally as good mixing as prescribed above for hand-mixing.
Machine-mixed concrete must be delivered from the machine upon
a wood or metal platform, or directly into barrows.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>36. Placing the Concrete.</strong>—Concrete shall be placed on the sub-grade
in such a manner as to prevent as far as possible the separation
of the mortar from the stone. It shall be evenly distributed in a
single horizontal layer of such depth that, after ramming, it will be
not less than&#160;... inches thick. Immediately after being
so placed it shall be well rammed until a compact mass is produced
with its upper surface parallel to and&#160;... inches
below the pavement datum. Depressions that may appear
during the ramming may be filled with concrete of the same
composition as used for the foundation, except that smaller-sized
stone shall be used; mortar alone must not be used for this
purpose, nor shall the upper surface of the concrete be plastered
with mortar. The surface of the concrete shall not be broomed or
troweled.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>37. Setting of Concrete.</strong>—After the concrete is completed it
shall remain undisturbed until it be firmly set. The time allowed
for setting shall not be less than five days, and as much longer as,
in the judgment of the Engineer, may be necessary, depending
upon the temperature of the weather and the setting qualities of
the cement. During this period no hauling or traveling over the
concrete must be permitted unless its surface be first protected by
a covering of plank. The Contractor shall, if necessary, keep the
concrete moist by wetting it, with hose, or otherwise, until
twenty-four (24) hours before it is to be covered with the pavement
surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>38. Measurement of Concrete.</strong>—Concrete will be measured and
computed in cubic yards as found completed on the street, the thickness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>being taken as&#160;... inches. The contract price
for concrete foundation covers the cost of providing all the materials
required, making, placing and ramming the concrete, and keeping
it moist for the necessary period.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>FOUNDATION OF OLD PAVING STONE</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>39.</strong> Foundations made of old stone paving blocks shall be constructed
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the sub-grade prepared as specified in Section 26, shall be
spread a layer of good sand to an even depth of one and one-half
(1½) inches. The paving blocks, whether taken up from the street
to be paved, or brought from other streets or storage yards, shall
be cleaned of all adhering earth, dirt and street refuse. The blocks
shall then be set on the bed of sand, on edge, perpendicular to
the grade, with their long dimension at right angles to the line of the
street, in courses composed of stones of the same width, extending
entirely across and at right angles to the axis of the street. Stones
in adjoining courses shall break joint at least two inches. Joints
between courses or stones, or along the curbstones, shall not exceed
one inch in width. The stone shall be fitted closely around manholes
or other structures in the street. The stones shall be so set
in the bed of sand that after being rammed as hereafter specified,
their tops shall be at the proper grade. After being thus set in
place the stone shall be rammed with paving rammers having
wooden faces and weighing not less than thirty (30) pounds, so as
to force each stone to a good bearing in the sand below, and to
bring its top to a uniform grade, parallel to and&#160;...
inches below the pavement datum. No stone shall project more
than one-fourth (¼) inch above the proper grade, and stones
whose tops, after ramming, are more than one-half (½) inch below
such grade, shall be raised, additional sand placed under them, and
reset and re-rammed to the proper grade and bearing. After the
ramming shall have been completed, the joints between the stones
shall be filled with mortar. The mortar shall be composed of Portland
cement and sand, complying with the specifications for these
materials in Sections 29 and 30. One part of cement and three
parts of sand, by volume, shall be thoroughly mixed dry, and then
made into mortar with sufficient quantity of water to produce a
mortar of such consistency that it will just flow freely into the joints
between the stones. All the joints between the stones must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>completely filled with this mortar before it has begun to set. The
mortar filling shall be brought even with, but not above, the tops
of the stones. After the filling is thus completed, the foundation
must stand undisturbed until the mortar shall have set firmly, in
no case less than five days. The mortar must be kept moist during
the period allowed for setting.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Old stone foundation will be measured in square yards, in place
after completion. The contract price includes the cost of handling
and cleaning the stone, supplying and placing the bed of sand, setting
and ramming the stone, supplying the materials for, making and
placing the mortar in the joints and watering the street while the
mortar is setting. Where stone is procured from other streets, or
from storage yards, the Contractor will be required to load, haul
and unload them, and will be allowed for this service a price of&#160;... cents per cubic yard for loading and unloading, plus&#160;...
cents per cubic yard for each one-half mile, or fraction thereof, over
which they are hauled by the nearest practicable route, the measurement
to be made after the stone is set in the street, without
deduction for joints.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>40. Broken Stone Foundation.</strong>—The sub-grade for broken stone
foundation shall be prepared as specified in Section 26, except that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the rolling may be omitted at the option of the Contractor. The
broken or crushed stone shall be of hard, durable stone. The
foundation shall have an aggregate thickness of&#160;... inches and
shall be constructed in two courses, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>The broken stone used in the first course shall be of such size
that it will all pass through a screen having openings three (3)
inches in diameter, and will all be retained on a screen having
openings one (1) inch in diameter. This stone shall be evenly
spread over the sub-grade to such a thickness that after being
thoroughly consolidated by rolling, its upper surface shall be three-fourths
inch below, and parallel to the surface of the foundation
when completed. It shall then be rolled with a road-roller weighing
not less than ten (10) tons until the stone is thoroughly compacted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second course, composed of screenings, all of which shall
have passed through a screen with openings one inch in diameter,
shall then be spread over the first course and well raked into the
voids of the first course. It shall then be thoroughly wetted, and
shall be rolled with the ten-ton roller until the fine stone is driven
into the interstices of the first course and the whole thoroughly
consolidated, the wetting being repeated while the rolling continues.
Additional screenings shall be added and rolled in where necessary
to bring the surface to the proper elevation. When completed, the
top surface of the foundation shall be&#160;... inches below,
and parallel to the pavement datum. No part of the upper surface
of the completed foundation shall project more than one-fourth (¼)
inch above, nor shall it be more than one-half (½) inch below the
grade and contour above specified.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gravel of a quality satisfactory to the Engineer may with his
written consent be substituted for broken stone. If of assorted
sizes, such as will compress into a mass having not more than thirty
(30) per cent. of voids, the foundation may be constructed in a
single layer, graded, watered and rolled, as prescribed above for
broken stone.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>41. Measurement.</strong>—Broken stone and gravel foundation will be
measured and computed by the cubic yard in the street as completed,
without any allowance for consolidation by the roller or for settlement
into the sub-grade, the thickness being taken as&#160;...
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>inches. The contract price for it shall cover the cost of
supplying the material, placing it on the street, and grading,
watering and rolling it.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>SHEET ASPHALT PAVEMENT</h3>

<p class='c006'><i>Note.</i>—A number of distinct varieties of asphalt are now used for
asphalt pavements, either alone or mixed. These different varieties differ
from each other quite widely in their physical and chemical properties.
Thus, in the form called “refined asphalt” some of their properties are
shown by the following table, the data for which is taken from the second

<p class='c007'>The practice has been heretofore, and is at the present time, to attempt
to make specifications for asphalt pavements broad enough to include all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the various varieties of asphalts, under general requirements which shall
admit these, and any new varieties that may appear on the market
suitable for the purpose, the object being to permit a wide range of competition.
This makes it exceedingly difficult if not impossible to frame
specifications that shall be sufficiently explicit and at the same time
sufficiently broad to admit these several differing materials. This practice
has been adhered to in these specifications, though in this respect they are
far from satisfactory to the author. So long as it continues to be the policy
of cities to admit these various varieties of bitumen under the same
general requirements for crude and refined material, such objectionable
specifications cannot be avoided. Even with the great latitude now
provided they exclude some materials with which good pavements have
been made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two remedies for this unsatisfactory condition seem practicable.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A city might purchase a sufficient supply of refined asphalt for its
use after asking for proposals under suitable specifications with alternative
requirements for the different varieties on the market, and after bids are
received and the samples accompanying them have been properly examined
in the laboratory, award contracts for a supply of one or more
kinds, as might seem best for the interests of the city. Stocks of these
would be delivered, tested and stored accordingly, in good time for the
season’s work. Specifications for construction with special reference to the
kind of asphalt it is proposed to use could then be prepared, the contractors
to be supplied with asphalt at the city storage yard at a stipulated
price per ton. This plan would possess a number of advantages. A
similar plan is quite commonly in use with reference to hydraulic cement.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Specifications might be framed with special reference to the properties
and qualities to be possessed by the <i>asphaltic cement</i>, permitting a liberal
range as to the crude and refined bitumens to be used in manufacturing
this cement. This would be considered, at the present time, a radical
departure from well established custom, but the author sees no reason
why it should not be satisfactorily employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sheet asphalt pavement is composed of two essential elements; a
mineral aggregate made up of sand of assorted sizes and mineral “dust”
and a bituminous cement. When properly compounded, manipulated
and compressed these elements make up a bituminous concrete suitable
for use as a wearing surface for streets and roads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The character of the sand is important and we have now sufficient
knowledge from experience to specify a sand that will give, approximately,
the best results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bituminous cement is, however, the element of most importance,
and upon its suitability for the purpose depends very largely the utility
and durability of the pavements made with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important that this asphaltic cement shall possess certain properties
and qualities, most of which we are now able to define satisfactorily, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>others require further practical and experimental study, and some tests
not now in use would doubtless be desirable.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not a matter of importance what particular crude or refined
materials enter into the composition of this cement if the resulting product
is satisfactory in use. The prime requisite is a paving cement that shall
possess in a high degree the chemical and physical qualities required for
making an asphalt pavement of the best quality. If we can devise
standards and tests that will enable us to secure such a cement we need not
be concerned about its antecedents.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be well worth while for paving engineers and those who have
laboratory facilities to give attention to this matter. If it shall be found
practicable to define satisfactorily the qualities the cement should possess
without reference to the materials from which it is compounded, a great
advance will have been made, and our asphalt paving specifications
could not only be greatly simplified, but much greater precision and definiteness
secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>While great advances have been made in the art of building sheet
asphalt pavements and in the framing of specifications for its construction,
too many of the specifications still in use are antiquated, indefinite and
unsatisfactory. Some of these contain requirements that, if literally
enforced, would prevent the attainment of the best results. They are
largely survivals of the time when little was known either practically or
technically of the science and art of constructing the pavements, outside
of the promoters and contractors in the business, who consequently
dictated, in a large measure, the specifications used. City engineers were
compelled to rely largely on the presumption that the guarantee clauses
of the contracts would insure good results, and allowed the contractor
wide latitude in the conduct of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>While there is undoubtedly much yet to learn, even by the experts, in
the matter of the materials to be used, a quite satisfactory working basis
has been arrived at, particularly as to the practical side of the work, and
a large mass of data accumulated by study and experience is available to
the municipal engineer, and the services of independent experts is readily
obtainable. There is no longer any good reason, therefore, why the
character of the materials to be used, the methods followed, and the quality
of the work secured should not be quite definitely and fully specified in
the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of other kinds of
pavement and with equally satisfactory results.</p>

must be secured, if necessary, by the admixture of two or more sands.
The sand shall be silicious and so free from organic matter, mica,
soft grains, and other impurities, that these shall not aggregate

sound stone or sand, pulverized to such fineness that the whole will
pass the No. 50 sieve, not more than ten (10) per cent. will be retained
on the No. 100 sieve, and at least seventy (70) per cent. of it

<p class='c007'><strong>50. Asphaltic Paving Cement.</strong>—Asphalt Paving Cement shall be
prepared from the refined asphalt described in Sect. 44 and the
tempering agent described in Sect. 47. The refined asphalt, together
with the asphalt in the tempering agent, shall constitute not less
than sixty per cent. (60%) of the asphaltic cement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The refined asphalt and the tempering agent shall be mixed and

agitation until a homogeneous cement is produced. The agitation
shall be continued until the cement is used.</p>

F. (77° F.) shall be of such consistency as to show a penetration of
from forty to eighty hundredths of a centimeter, as the engineer

penetration apparatus, using a number two cambric needle loaded
with one hundred grams. When a cement of a consistency satisfactory
to the engineer has been produced and approved for any
street a sample of it shall be kept as a standard and all subsequent
batches or kettles must be made to conform thereto, suitable apparatus
and tests being employed to determine the correspondence

be varied as may be found necessary or desirable by the Engineer
to suit the purity of the asphaltic cement, the character of the sand,
the climatic conditions, and the varying quantity and character of
travel on the street to be paved; and Portland cement may be substituted
partly or wholly for the pulverized stone, when directed
by the Engineer. The surface-course mixture shall be submitted
to the Engineer and approved by him before any is laid upon the
street.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mixing shall be accomplished in a mechanical mixing
apparatus capable of rapidly and effectually incorporating the materials
together, and each batch must remain in the mixer a sufficient
length of time to effect a perfect mixture. The sand shall be
separately heated and shall reach the mixing apparatus at a temperature
not above three hundred and fifty (350) degrees F., nor
below three hundred and twenty (320) degrees F. The pulverized
stone shall be at such a temperature that when mixed with
the sand the temperature of the mixed mass shall not be above
three hundred and fifty (350) degrees F., nor below three hundred
and twenty (320) degrees F. The sand shall be first placed
in the mixer, followed by the pulverized stone, and these two
materials shall be thoroughly mixed together before the asphaltic
cement is added. The asphaltic cement at a temperature not above
three hundred and fifty (350) degrees, nor below three hundred
(300) degrees F. shall then be added in such a way as to evenly
distribute it over the sand and pulverized stone, and the mixing
continued until the materials are thoroughly incorporated into a
perfectly uniform and homogeneous mass, with the grains of sand
completely covered with cement. Suitable thermometers shall be
constantly used to determine the temperatures specified herein.

completely filled.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>54. Mixing the Base-course.</strong>—The materials for the base-course
shall be heated and mixed in the same general manner as prescribed
for the surface-course (Sect. 51), the crushed stone being delivered
first in the mixer. The temperature of the mixture as it comes
from the mixer being not above three hundred and twenty-five
(325) degrees F., nor below three hundred (300) degrees F.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>55. Laying Asphalt Pavement, General.</strong>—Asphalt pavement
must not be laid except when the surface upon which it is to be placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>is dry; nor when the temperature of the air is below thirty-two (32)
degrees F., or, if a strong wind prevails, when the temperature of
the air is below forty (40) degrees F.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pavement mixture, whether for base- or surface-course,
shall be taken to the street as soon after it leaves the mixer as practicable.
When the temperature of the air is below seventy (70)
degrees F., the loaded vehicles conveying the mixture to the street
shall be covered by canvas covers to prevent the escape of heat.
When unloaded upon the street, the temperature of the mass should
not be below two hundred and eighty (280) degrees F., and any
load or portions of a load found under two hundred and forty (240)
degrees F. must be rejected. After being unloaded on the street,
the mixture must be shoveled into place in such a manner that the
whole of it will be moved from the pile into which it was unloaded.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>56. Laying the Base-course.</strong>—The base-course will have an
average thickness of one and one-quarter (1¼) inches after compression.
It shall be laid directly upon the pavement foundation, which
must be free from all loose fragments and rubbish and be swept clean
in advance of the application of the base-course. The base-course
mixture shall be spread upon the foundation and evenly and regularly
graded to such a depth that after compression by the roller
its surface will be&#160;... inches below, and truly parallel
to, the pavement datum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great care must be taken in handling, spreading and grading
the mixture to maintain the uniform admixture of the crushed stone
throughout the mass. The rakes used must have tines wide apart,
and the back of the rake must be principally used for grading.
Immediately after being graded, and while still hot, the base-course
shall be rolled with an asphalt roller weighing not less than five
tons, the rolling being continued until no further compression takes
place.</p>

<p class='c007'>The base-course must not be laid more than one day’s work in
advance of the surface-course.</p>

appearance and texture over the whole surface, which must conform
so truly to the designed grade and contour that a twelve-foot template,
when applied, will show no departure from the true surface
greater than one-quarter (¼) inch.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>57. Laying the Surface-course.</strong>—In delivering the surface-course
mixture upon the base-course, care must be taken not to
break or disturb the latter. Any breaks made in the base-course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>must be so repaired, before the surface-course is spread, as to be
equal in density and surface to the adjoining base.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the surface-course is spread the base-course must be
thoroughly cleaned and all rubbish, loose material and street dirt
removed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The material for the surface-course shall be so evenly spread
and graded with asphalt rakes that after it is properly compacted
by rolling, the surface will coincide with the pavement datum
within the limits named below. In grading the material, all lumps
must be broken up and the whole reduced to a finely comminuted
mass of equal density throughout. Directly after being so graded
it shall be rolled with a hand-roller, or light steam-roller, to partly
compress the material, and, when so directed by the Engineer, the
surface shall then be ironed with smoothing irons heated to a temperature
that will melt, but not burn, the asphaltic cement. A
thin layer of hydraulic cement, just sufficient to prevent adhesion
between the material and the roller, shall then be swept over the
surface, which shall at once be thoroughly rolled with a ten-ton
asphalt roller until the material shall be thoroughly compressed
and its surface be brought to the exact grade and contour designed
for the street surface. The work of the ten-ton steam-roller must
begin before the material has cooled below two hundred (200)
degrees F., and be continued until the roller makes no further
impression upon the surface. The first course of the heavy rolling
shall be parallel to the street beginning at the curb and working
toward the center on each side, after which it should be diagonally
rolled, and also cross-rolled if the width of the street permits.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Any
portions of the surface not accessible to the roller shall be tamped
with hot tampers until compacted equally with the rolled portion.
When completed, the surface shall have an average thickness of&#160;... inches and must be so free from waves or irregularities
that a template not less than twelve feet long, when applied
to the street surface shall nowhere show a divergence from the
designed true surface of more than three-sixteenths (³⁄₁₆) inch,
and a template sixteen (16) feet long applied to the gutters shall
show no divergence from the true gutter grade greater than one-eighth
(⅛) inch.</p>

crosswalks, manholes, etc., with which the surface-course will
be in contact, must be well painted with hot paving cement or
approved pitch. The street shall not be opened to travel until the
pavement has become cold and hard.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>58. Street Railroad Tracks.</strong>—Where railroad tracks exist on the
streets, the sub-grade and the pavement foundation shall extend
under the tracks, uninterrupted except by the ties and other structures
connected with the track. Where concrete foundation is used,
special care must be taken with the concrete directly under or around
the rails, and concrete made of fine crushed stone and a higher ratio of
cement and sand may be required in contact with the rail. The
concrete must be thoroughly tamped under and against the rail.</p>

<p class='c007'>The asphalt surface shall be laid directly against the rails, which,
if their temperature be under fifty (50) degrees F., shall be heated
by suitable appliances to a temperature of, or above, sixty (60)
degrees F. immediately before the asphalt material is placed around
the rail. The hot asphalt material must be thoroughly tamped
against and along the rail and under any projecting portions of it,
and the surface of the pavement must be even with, or slightly
(not more than one-eighth (⅛) inch) above the top of the rail.
Slot-rails will be treated in the same manner, subject to such modifications
as their forms may necessitate.<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>59. Plant.</strong>—The plant for making asphalt paving mixtures must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>be of approved modern design, adapted to do the work properly, and
equipped with efficient machinery. It shall be of sufficient capacity
to turn out at least twelve hundred square yards of pavement surface
daily without crowding. Weighing and measuring devices shall be
accurate and adapted to the purpose, and must be frequently tested
and adjusted. Each plant must be supplied with the apparatus
necessary to make all determinations and tests required at the plant
to properly conduct the work in accordance with these specifications.
Steam-rollers must be properly balanced and the rolling surface
must be true and smooth. All the street tools used must be of

<p class='c007'><strong>65. Manufacture.</strong>—The crushed rock, sand and pulverized stone
shall be thoroughly mixed together at a temperature not above
three hundred and seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit (375° F.) and
not below three hundred and twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit
(325° F.) and the asphaltic cement, at a like temperature, added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and the mixing continued until a perfectly uniform mass is produced,
with every fragment of stone completely coated with cement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hot mixture will then be compressed in molds under a pressure
not less than four thousand (4000) pounds<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> per square inch, after
which the blocks will be removed from the molds and allowed to
cool, either in the air or in water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The completed blocks after cooling in air shall have a specific
gravity of not less than 2.5. They shall not absorb, when immersed
in water for twenty-four hours, more than one-half of one per cent.
of water. When tested in the standard rattler for testing paving
brick the average loss by abrasion shall not exceed twelve per cent.
(12%) of their original weight, after 1800 revolutions of the rattler.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>66. Laying the Blocks.</strong><a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a>—The foundation shall be first cleaned of
dirt, rubbish or loose material.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the blocks are four (4) inches or less in depth as laid, they
shall be set upon a bed of mortar made and applied to the foundation
in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>The mortar shall be composed of Portland cement and sand,
in the ratio of one (1) part cement to three (3) parts of sand, thoroughly
mixed with sufficient water to make a rather soft mortar.
This mortar shall be spread over the foundation, which shall be
previously wetted, in a layer approximately one-half (½) inch
thick and its top graded by the use of templates to a surface at such
depth below, and truly parallel to the pavement datum, that when
the blocks are firmly set in it and rammed their tops will be in the
true grade and contour of the pavement. The mortar shall be made
and spread only as required in the progress of block laying, and any
mortar that has begun to set before the blocks are in place and
rammed, shall be removed and fresh mortar substituted. The blocks
shall be set upon this mortar bed with their longest dimension across
the street, in continuous courses which shall be straight and at right
angles to the axis of the street. The block layers must stand upon
the blocks already laid and not upon the mortar. The blocks and
the courses of blocks shall be set as closely together as practicable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Blocks in adjoining courses must break joint not less than four
inches. Whole blocks only will be used, except as fillers at the ends
of the courses or in fitting the pavement around manholes or other
structures, and where thus used the broken ends of the blocks must
be dressed to make close joints. Unless otherwise permitted, each
course must be laid continuously across the street without interruption
in time. As each course is completed the end joints shall
be forced close together by the use of wedges, levers or mauls.
Upon the completion of every third course, the courses shall be forced
together by placing a timber scantling against the face of the last
course and striking it with a sledge or maul. When the blocks are
thus laid, and before the mortar under them begins to set, they shall
be well rammed to a solid bearing in the mortar with a wooden
street rammer weighing not less than thirty (30) pounds, a two inch
plank ten (10) inches wide and three (3) feet long being interposed
between the block and the rammer and moved about so that the whole
surface shall be covered and rammed. When the ramming is completed,
the top of the blocks must conform so closely to the pavement
datum that when a template or straight-edge is placed upon the
pavement, its surface shall nowhere depart from the true surface
more than three-sixteenths (³⁄₁₆) inch. Blocks, or portions of the
pavement found too high or too low, must be taken up and reset in
fresh mortar to the true grade. When thus completed to the
satisfaction of the Engineer, a layer of one-half (½) inch of fine
dry sand shall be placed over the surface and swept about with
brooms until all joints are completely filled. The remaining sand
shall be removed from the pavement at such time as the Engineer
may direct.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the depth of the blocks exceeds four (4) inches, they may
be set upon a cushion course of sand, as prescribed for brick pavement,
Section 86, the joints to be filled with sand, as specified above
in this Section.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>67. Railroad Tracks.</strong>—Where railroad tracks exist on the street to
be paved, the construction shall be the same as prescribed for
granite block pavement, Section 78.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>68.</strong> The street shall not be opened to travel until the mortar
under the blocks shall have become fully set, and in no case under
five days after the blocks are laid.</p>

inclusive.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>71. Granite Blocks.</strong>—The blocks shall be made from sound,
durable granite, of uniform texture, composition and hardness
throughout. No outcrop, deteriorated, soft, brittle, or seamy stone
shall be used. If the blocks are obtained from different quarries,
or from different parts of the same quarry where the quality or
appearance of the rock differs, the product of each must be kept
separate and laid together on the street.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The blocks shall be not less than eight (8) nor more than twelve
(12) inches long, not less than three and one-half (3½) nor more
than four and one-half (4½) inches wide, and not less than four
and three-quarters (4¾) nor more than five and one-quarter

so that joints between the courses will nowhere exceed three-fourths
(¾) inch wide, and their ends so that end joints shall not exceed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>one-half (½) inch wide.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> The size of the blocks may be varied
where necessary to fit the pavement against or around bridge stones

<p class='c007'><strong>72. Sand Cushion.</strong>—The foundation shall be cleaned of all dirt
and rubbish. There shall then be spread evenly over it a layer of
clean, coarse sand to a uniform depth of one and one-half (1½)
inches.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>73. Setting the Blocks.</strong>—The blocks shall be set in this bed of
sand perpendicular to the street surface, with their length at right
angles to the street, in courses extending entirely across the street,
and at right angles to its axis, except at street intersections where
the courses shall be arranged as the Engineer may direct.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Only
stones of the same width shall be set in the same course. The stones
in each course, and in adjoining courses, shall be set firmly against
each other. The blocks shall be set in the sand bed in such a manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>that their bottom surface shall rest evenly upon the sand and
that their tops shall be even with each other and to such an elevation
that after the pavement is rammed, as hereinafter directed, its general
surface shall conform closely to the pavement datum. Stones
in adjoining courses shall break joint not less than three (3) inches.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>74. Ramming.</strong><a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a>—After the blocks are set each individual block
shall be thoroughly rammed to give it a firm bearing in the sand
and to bring its top to the prescribed pavement datum. The rammers
used shall have wooden faces not more than four inches in
diameter, and shall weigh not less than thirty (30) pounds. Blocks
or sections of blocks whose tops under the ramming remain above
or sink below the pavement datum shall be taken up and reset so
that after the ramming is completed their tops shall coincide with
the pavement datum.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>75. Filling the Joints.</strong><a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a>—After the ramming specified in Sect. 74
shall have been completed, the joints between the paving blocks
shall be filled in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>All the joints for a distance of three feet out from the curbstones,
and three contiguous joints continuous across the street, with the
included end joints, at intervals of about fifty (50) feet in the
length of the street, shall be filled with gravel and bituminous
paving cement. The gravel used shall be of such size that all will
pass through a screen having five-eighths (⅝) inch meshes, and
all will be held on a screen having one-fourth (¼) inch meshes.
When used, the gravel must be free from refuse and street dirt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The bituminous paving cement shall be composed by weight of
straight-run coal-tar pitch of the hardness commonly known as
number six, to which has been added and thoroughly mixed, while
both are in a melted condition, twenty per cent. (20%) by weight
of refined Trinidad asphalt, or other asphalt, equal for the purpose,
and twenty per cent. (20%) by weight of Portland cement. These
ingredients must be thoroughly mixed, and kept agitated until
used.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The joints will first be filled with the gravel, which shall be perfectly
dry, and heated so that when put in the joints it will be at a
temperature of about three hundred (300) degrees F. The paving
cement, heated to a temperature of about three hundred (300)
degrees F., shall be at once, while the gravel is still hot, poured
from a spouted vessel into the joints until the interstices of the gravel
are entirely filled to the surface of the pavement, repouring being
resorted to to accomplish this result whenever necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the joints in the pavement other than those named above
shall then be completely filled with Portland cement grout, in the
following manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>The grout shall be composed of equal parts by volume of sand
(Sect. 30) and Portland cement (Sect. 29), a quick-setting cement
being preferred. The sand and cement shall be first thoroughly
mixed dry and then enough water added to make a grout of such
consistency that it will flow like thick cream, and the mixing continued
until a homogeneous mass is produced and until the grout
is applied to the pavement. The grout shall be prepared in water-tight
boxes of a convenient size. Before applying the grout the
pavement shall be thoroughly dampened by sprinkling. The grout
shall be removed from the mixing box and spread over the pavement
with scoop shovels, in two courses, the first being sufficient
to about half fill the joints, and the second, which shall be applied
before the first has begun to set, shall be sufficient to entirely fill
the remaining space in the joints. As the grout is applied to the
pavement it shall be swept about with brooms until it all enters
the joints.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><strong>76. Order of Work.</strong>—The sand bed shall not be put in place more
than fifty (50) feet ahead of the block setters. The ramming and
filling of the joints shall follow closely the block setting, but no ramming
shall be done within less than six (6) feet of the face of the
block setting; and the final joint filling shall be kept completed to
within twenty-five (25) feet of the ramming; except that all the
work rammed during any day shall have the joint filling completed
before the cessation of work on that day. The street shall not be
opened to travel until the grout has thoroughly set.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>77. Fitting Paving Around Other Structures.</strong>—The size of blocks
and the width of courses shall, as the block laying approaches bridge
stones, curbs and other structures, or in making closures with other
sections of pavement, be so selected and adjusted that joints not
over three-quarters (¾) inch in width shall result, without breaking
blocks or splitting courses.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>78. Street Railroad Tracks.</strong>—Where railroad tracks exist in the
street the paving blocks shall be laid against the rail in the following
manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>The sub-grade and the pavement foundation shall extend under
the rails uninterrupted except by the ties or other structures connected
with the railroad track. For a distance of sixteen (16)
inches, on each side of the rail, measuring from the center thereof,
there shall be spread on the pavement foundation a layer of mortar
not less than one and one-half (1½) inches thick, composed of one
(1) part of cement and three (3) parts sand, complying with the
requirements of Sections 29 and 30. Upon this layer of mortar shall
be set, against the rail, and on each side of it, selected paving
blocks, securely bedded in the mortar before it shall have begun to
set.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Alternate blocks shall be long and short so as to break joint
with the blocks of the adjoining pavement. Selected blocks with
well dressed top surfaces shall be used and their tops shall be set
as nearly as practicable at the level of the top of the rail, but not so
high that the car wheels will ride upon them. In setting the blocks
they shall be firmly bedded into the mortar by the use of paving
hammers, but they shall not be thereafter rammed. As the blocks
are set, any space between the paving blocks and the web of the rail
shall be filled with mortar of the quality described above. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>placing of these blocks shall not precede by more than ten (10)
feet the block laying on the street. Care must be taken not to
disturb the bedding of these blocks in the laying of the adjoining
pavement, or otherwise. The joints shall be filled with grout as
specified in Sect. 75.</p>

<p class='c007'>The construction along slot-rails shall be the same as described
above, except that blocks of special size or shape may be required,
as the Engineer may direct.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>79. Bridge Stone Crossings.</strong>—Where directed by the Engineer,
the old bridge stone shall be redressed and relaid, as hereinafter
specified for new bridge stone, and shall be moved from the point
where taken up to the point where they are to be relaid, by the
Contractor at his expense.</p>

<p class='c007'>New bridge stone shall be of the same quality of granite as the
paving blocks and free from imperfections. They shall not be less
than three and one-half (3½) nor more than six (6) feet long,
eighteen (18) inches wide and of a uniform thickness not less than
six (6) nor more than eight (8) inches, but these dimensions may
be varied by the Engineer where necessary to fit the stone into
special locations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their top shall be well dressed to a true plane surface not varying
in evenness more than one-quarter (¼) inch. The sides shall be
dressed perpendicular to the face so as to joint closely against the
paving blocks. The ends shall be cut to lines making an angle of
from 60° to 45° with the longitudinal axis of the stones<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a> and so
dressed and to such a bevel that when set in the curved surface
of the street, the joint between adjoining stones shall not be wider
than three-eighths (⅜) inch from top to bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bridge stones shall be set in advance of the block laying, over the
concrete street foundation, in a bed of sand or gravel in which they
shall be firmly bedded. Their upper surface shall conform truly
to the pavement datum. They shall be set accurately to the lines
given by the Engineer. Where the crosswalk requires more than
one width of bridge stone, the courses shall be laid parallel to, and
at such distance from each other as the Engineer may direct, and
the space between courses shall be filled with paving blocks laid as
specified for other parts of the street.</p>

one-fourth (1¼) inches. The surface of the foundation shall not
vary more than one-half (½) inch above or below that depth.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>82. Paving Brick.</strong>—The linear dimensions of paving brick may

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The brick must be specially manufactured for paving purposes.
They may be made from shale or from suitable clay. In either case
the material must be thoroughly pulverized, mixed and tempered,
and must be free from lime nodules or other substances that may
disintegrate the brick when immersed in water. The brick shall be
molded in efficient brick machines to a truly rectangular form, free
from cracks, flaws and injurious laminations. After being dried
the brick shall be properly and uniformly burned in down-draft
kilns. Shale brick shall be burned to the point of incipient
fusion or vitrification. After the burning is completed, the brick
shall be allowed to cool with sufficient slowness to insure thorough
annealing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The completed brick shall be free from flaws, cracks, ragged

their quality:</p>

<p class='c007'>When broken by the blows of a hammer the brick shall be strong
and tough. The broken surface shall show a homogeneous composition
throughout the broken section, free from flaws, injurious
laminations, nodules and voids, and shall appear to be uniformly
burned from surface to center.</p>

<p class='c007'>When subjected to the standard “Rattler” test, in accordance
with the rules adopted by the National Paving Brick Manufacturers’
Association, the average loss in weight shall not exceed eighteen (18)
per cent.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and the loss in weight of any individual brick in the test

rules adopted by the National Paving Brick Manufacturers’ Association,
shale bricks shall not absorb more than two (2) per cent. nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>less than one-half (½) of one per cent. of their weight of water,<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and
clay bricks shall not absorb more than six (6) per cent. of their
weight of water; the absorption of any individual brick shall not
be more than fifty (50) per cent. greater than the mean absorption
of the whole lot tested.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Brick that do not successfully pass all these
tests will not be accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>84. Samples.</strong>—Where samples of paving brick have been required
and submitted by successful bidders, and tested as described above,
it will be assumed that these samples fairly represent the quality of
the brick to be subsequently supplied for the work, and brick that
do not come up to the standard thus established will not be accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>85. Delivering Brick on Street.</strong>—Unless the sidewalks are too
narrow to permit of it, the brick shall all be delivered upon the
street before the foundation is constructed, and neatly piled upon
the outer edge of the sidewalks; occasional openings being left in
the piles for the accommodation of foot passengers. One-half the
brick required shall be thus delivered and piled upon each sidewalk.
In delivering the bricks from these piles to the bricklayers, they must
be carried on pallets, or other suitable devices must be used to prevent
mutilation by rough handling; they must not be dumped from
wheelbarrows upon freshly-laid brick pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'>If for any reason the bricks are not delivered before the foundation
is laid, or if the sidewalks are too narrow to permit of the
brick being stored upon them, they may be delivered over the foundation,
but not until the concrete has set so hard that it will not be
injured by transportation over it.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>86. Sand Cushion.</strong>—Directly before the brick are laid into the
pavement there shall be spread over the foundation a layer of sand
one and one-half (1½) inches in depth. The sand shall be free
from vegetable or other refuse matter, and shall not contain more
than five (5) per cent. of clay and loam. Pebbles and fragments
of stone exceeding one-fourth inch in diameter must be screened out.
When spread on the street the sand shall be sufficiently dry to permit
of proper gaging by templates, as hereinafter described. The
sand shall be spread and correctly gaged to the proper thickness
and surface by the use of templates formed to the true designed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>cross-sectional contour of the pavement. If the width of the street
between curbs does not exceed twenty-five (25) feet, the template
shall be made in one length sufficient to cover the full width of the
street, and its ends shall be so constructed and fitted with iron rollers,
that it will rest upon and roll along the top of the curb at each end;
if the width of the street between curbs be not more than fifty (50)
feet, the template shall be of sufficient length to reach from the
curb to the middle of the street, and constructed to move on rollers
on top of the curb at one end and upon a plank six (6) inches wide
and one and one-half (1½) inches thick laid upon the foundation
along the center line of the pavement. The template shall be worked
forward and backward along the line of the street until the surface
of the sand conforms exactly to the designed contour of the pavement,
at a depth below the pavement datum equal to the depth of
the paving brick minus one-fourth (¼) inch. The whole surface
shall then be rolled with a garden roller not less than thirty-six
inches long and not less than thirty inches in diameter, weighing
not less than three hundred pounds. When completed the surface
of the sand cushion shall be smooth and unbroken, and care must be
taken not to disturb it before the bricks are set upon it.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>87. Setting the Brick.</strong>—Several courses of brick, aggregating a
strip having a width of not less than twelve (12) inches nor more
than fifteen (15) inches on each side of the street, beginning against
the curb, shall be first laid; the brick being set with their long dimension
parallel to the curb.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The pavement intervening between
these gutter courses will then be set in courses at right angles to the
axis of the street, except in street intersections, where the courses
shall make an angle of forty-five (45) degrees with the axis of the
street. The brick shall be set upon edge on the sand cushion with
their top faces parallel to the pavement datum, in straight courses,
continuous across the street, the long dimension of the brick being
parallel to the courses; they shall be set as closely together as possible,
so that the joints both between the courses and between individual
bricks shall not exceed one-eighth (⅛) inch, where the bricks are
without lugs, and not more than one-fourth inch where the brick
have lugs. Broken bricks and bats shall not be used except as
closers at the ends of the course and in fitting the pavement around
manholes, etc., and nothing smaller than half-bricks shall be used in
either case, and the broken ends must be shaped to make reasonably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>close joints. Filling up with bats must follow the brick-laying
closely. Brick with lugs shall be laid with the lugs all in one
direction.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>88. Inspection.</strong>—After the bricks are laid the pavement will be
inspected by the Engineer, or his agent. He may require that the
surface shall be previously wetted by sprinklers, or by a sprinkling
nozzle, in order to detect soft or porous bricks.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Defective bricks
indicated by him shall be removed and replaced by acceptable
brick.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>89. Rolling and Ramming.</strong>—The surface of the pavement shall
then be rolled and rammed in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>The roller used shall be of the asphalt roller style, driven by
steam and weighing not less than three and one-half (3½) nor more
than five (5) tons. The rolling shall begin as near the curb as
practicable, the roller being operated slowly, parallel to the axis
of the street, and working outwardly until the center of the street
is reached, when the roller will proceed to the opposite side of the
street and the operation proceed as before. After this longitudinal
rolling is completed the pavement will be continuously rolled a
second time, the roller operating back and forth at an angle of
forty-five degrees to the axis of the street, and a third time, the
roller operating at right angles to the course of the second rolling.
After the rolling is thus completed the brick in the gutters not
reached by the roller shall be rammed with a street rammer weighing
not less than thirty (30) pounds, a plank not less than four (4)
feet long, ten (10) to twelve (12) inches wide and two (2) inches
thick being interposed between the pavement and the rammer and
moved about so that the whole surface of the gutter shall be thoroughly
and equally rammed and its surface brought to an even
junction with the rolled portion of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the rolling and ramming is thus completed the surface
of the pavement shall conform so truly to the designed pavement
datum that it will nowhere depart more than three-sixteenths (³⁄₁₆)
inch from properly formed templates and straight-edges applied to
its surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>90. Filling the Joints.</strong><a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a>—Directly after the completion of the rolling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and ramming, the joints between the bricks shall be filled as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>The joints in the longitudinal gutter courses, and the joints
between six contiguous courses running across the street, from
gutter to gutter, in each length of fifty (50) feet of the pavement,
shall be filled with bituminous cement composed of coal-tar pitch,
commercially known as Number Four, to which has been added
twenty (20) per cent. of refined Trinidad asphalt and twenty (20)
per cent. of hydraulic cement, all by weight. In preparing this
bituminous cement, the pitch shall first be melted and the asphalt,
also melted, added and thoroughly incorporated by agitation. The
hydraulic cement shall then be added and the whole agitated until
a complete and uniform mixture results. The bituminous cement
thus prepared shall while sufficiently hot and liquid to flow freely,
be poured from a spouted vessel into the joints until they appear
to be nearly or quite full. After allowing time for the filling to
subside, the joints will be gone over a second time and completely
filled.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the remaining joints in the pavement shall be filled with
Portland cement grout, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>The grout will be composed of equal parts by volume of sand
(Sect. 30) and Portland cement (Sect. 29), a quick-setting cement
being preferred. The sand and cement shall be first thoroughly
mixed dry and then enough water added to make a grout of such
consistency that it will flow like thick cream, and the mixing continued
until a homogeneous mass is produced and until the grout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>is applied to the pavement. The grout shall be prepared in water-tight
boxes of a convenient size. Before applying the grout the
pavement shall be thoroughly dampened by sprinkling. The grout
shall be spread over the pavement with scoop shovels, in two
courses, the first being sufficient to nearly fill the joints, and the
second, which shall be applied before the first has begun to set,
shall be sufficient to entirely fill the remaining space in the joints.
As rapidly as the grout is applied it shall be swept with brooms until
it all enters the joints.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>91.</strong> Travel must be excluded from the pavement until the grout
has set firmly; in no case less than five days, and the grout must
be kept moist during this period.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>WOOD-BLOCK PAVEMENT</h3>

<p class='c006'><strong>92. Sub-grade.</strong>—The sub-grade for wood-block pavement shall
be prepared as specified in Section 26, and shall be finished to a
surface&#160;... inches below the pavement datum.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>93. Foundation.</strong>—The foundation for wood-block pavement shall
be Portland cement concrete&#160;... inches thick, prepared
as specified in Sections 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37.
The upper surface of the concrete foundation, when completed, shall
be at a distance below the pavement datum equal to the depth of
the blocks to be laid, plus one-half (½) inch, and must not vary
more than one-fourth (¼) inch above or below that depth.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>
  <h4 class='c014'>MATERIALS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c015'><strong>94. Wood-blocks.</strong>—The wood-blocks may be made of Long-leaved
yellow pine (Pinus palustrus), Lob-lolly pine (Pinus tæda),
Short-leaved pine (Pinus echinata), Cuba pine (Pinus heterophylla),
Black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), Red gum (Liquidambar styraciflua),
Norway pine (Pinus resinosa), or Tamarack (Larix laricina), or of
other species of wood of equal strength and toughness and of a
texture permitting as satisfactory preservative treatment as those
herein named. But, as far as practicable, only one species of wood
shall be used on any one contract.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Only wood from live, sound trees shall be used. The lumber from
which the blocks are cut shall be properly manufactured, free from
bark, and with full square corners. It shall be free from decay,
dottiness, brashness, shakes, large season cracks, loose or unsound
knots over three-fourths (¾) inch in diameter, and all other imperfections
which may, in the opinion of the Engineer, be detrimental.
“Fat” pine containing so much resin that it will not take
up the specified quantity of creosote oil in treatment may be rejected.
Second-growth timber, and Southern pine showing, outside of a
radius of three (3) inches from the heart, nine (9) or less annual
growth rings to the inch, will not be accepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paving blocks made from the lumber hereinbefore specified
shall be well manufactured and truly rectangular and square edged.
Their depth (parallel to the fiber) shall be&#160;... inches,<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a>
their length shall not be less than six inches nor more than three
times their depth, and their width shall be from two and one-half
(2½) to three and one-half (3½) inches, but at least one-fourth
inch less than their depth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>All the blocks for any one contract shall be of the same standard
depth and width, and the individual blocks shall not vary more
than one-eighth inch from the designated depth and width.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>95. Creosote Oil.</strong><a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a>—The oil used for the preservative treatment
of the paving blocks shall be coal-tar creosote oil, commonly known
as dead oil of coal-tar, without admixture or adulteration with other
oils or tars. Oils produced or resulting from the distillation of
water-gas tar, blast-furnace tar, producer-tar, lignite-tar, petroleum-oil
tar, or wood-tar, or, containing an admixture of any of these will
not be accepted. The creosote oil shall not contain more than five
per cent. (5%) of tarry matter nor more than two per cent. (2%) of
water. Its specific gravity at a temperature of 100° F. shall be
not below 1.03 nor above 1.08. Not less than ninety-nine per cent.
(99%) shall be soluble in hot benzol. It shall not contain more than
eight per cent. (8%) of tar acids. When two hundred (200) grams
are subjected to distillation at gradually increasing temperatures,
not more than five per cent. (5%) of distillate shall distil over up
to a temperature of four hundred degrees F. (400° F.), nor more
than thirty-five per cent. (35%) shall distil over up to a temperature
of four hundred and fifty-five degrees F. (455° F.), and not more
than eighty per cent. (80%) shall distil over up to a temperature of
six hundred degrees F. (600° F.). After complete distillation there
shall not remain more than two per cent. of coke. The residue
remaining, upon sulphonating a portion of the total distillate, shall
not exceed one per cent. (1%). The above tests shall be made in
accordance with the methods prescribed in the “Report of the
Committee on Preservative Treatment of Poles and Cross-arms”
of the National Electric Light Association, 1911.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>96. Preservative Treatment.</strong>—The paving blocks shall, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>they are cut to the proper dimensions, be subjected to preservative
treatment with the creosote oil specified in Section 95.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contractor may employ any of the standard methods in
common use for impregnating the blocks, provided that uniform
results are attained, complying with the following requirements:</p>

<p class='c007'>The wood shall not be heated during any part of the process to a
temperature exceeding two hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit
(260° F.).</p>

<p class='c007'>All parts of every block shall be reached and penetrated by the oil.
The quantity of oil found in the blocks after treatment shall average
not less than&#160;... pounds per cubic foot of wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The oil in the treating tanks during the process of impregnation
shall not become diluted with water to the extent of more than five
per cent. (5%) and if the percentage of water in the oil during the
process of treatment shall exceed two per cent. (2%) the quantity
of the oil to be injected in the wood as stipulated hereinbefore shall
be increased in a like ratio; for example, if the oil in the treating
tanks shall be found to contain four per cent. (4%) of water the
quantity required to be found in the blocks after treatment shall be
four per cent. (4%) greater than herein specified.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quantity of oil injected shall be determined primarily by
tank measurements, but shall be verified by actual determination
of the quantity of oil in the treated blocks by the following method:
representative treated sample blocks shall be selected and an auger
hole one inch in diameter bored entirely through the block parallel
to the fiber, the borings all collected, thoroughly mixed, and the
quantity and ratio of oil to wood in the borings determined by
extracting the oil completely with carbon di-sulphide. The center
of the auger hole shall be located midway between the sides of the
block and at a distance from the end of the block equal to one-third
(⅓) of the length of the block. At the time of treatment the blocks
shall not be green or saturated with water, but they shall, preferably,
not be thoroughly seasoned. After treatment, and until used, the
blocks shall, during dry weather, be frequently well drenched
with water to prevent excessive drying out and cracking.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>97. Laying the Wood-Blocks.</strong>—The concrete foundation shall be
cleaned and swept to remove all dirt and débris and shall be thoroughly
dampened immediately in advance of the setting of the
blocks. Upon the concrete foundation shall be spread a layer of
mortar about one-half inch thick, made of one part Portland cement
and two parts sand with sufficient water to make a moderately stiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>paste.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> The mortar shall be thoroughly mixed and shall be spread
in place over the concrete foundation immediately in advance of
setting the blocks to such a thickness that when the blocks are set
and properly tamped their tops shall conform accurately to the
pavement datum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon this mortar bed the blocks shall be set with their fiber
vertical, in straight, parallel courses at right angles to the axis of
the street, except at street intersections where they shall be set at an
angle of forty-five degrees with the axis of the street. The blocks
shall be set as close together as practicable. Blocks in adjoining
courses shall break joint at least three inches. Blocks of such lengths
shall be selected as to make as little splitting as practicable in filling
out ends of courses. Where splitting is necessary, no fractional
block shall be used whose length is not at least equal to its width.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the blocks are thus set the whole surface of the pavement
shall be rammed with a rammer weighing not less than twenty
pounds, a plank ten (10) inches wide, two (2) inches thick and four
feet long being interposed between the rammer and the pavement
and moved about as the ramming progresses until the blocks are
forced into a firm seat in the mortar bed and their tops brought
accurately to the pavement datum. The ramming shall be completed
before the mortar under them has begun to set, but no ramming
shall be done, during the progress of the work, nearer than three
feet to the edge of the block setting, except where the block setting
may be suspended, as at the end of the day’s work, when all the
blocks then set shall be rammed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The top surface of the pavement when completed shall conform so
truly to the pavement datum that correctly formed templates twelve
(12) feet long applied to the surface shall show at no place a departure
of more than three-sixteenths (³⁄₁₆) inch therefrom.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><strong>98. Filling the Joints.</strong>—After the block setting is completed,
perfectly dry, fine sand shall be spread over the pavement surface
and swept about until every joint into which the sand will penetrate
shall be completely filled. The remaining sand shall be left
upon the pavement for such time as the Engineer may direct, when
it shall be removed by the Contractor.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>99. Inspection.</strong>—The lumber for paving blocks will be inspected
before it is cut into blocks. The blocks will also be inspected
upon delivery to the street and as they are laid. Blocks that have,
in treatment or subsequent handling, developed open season cracks
or wind shakes or other imperfections that may prevent their durability
or usefulness in the pavement shall be rejected and removed
from the street.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>100. Chamfered Blocks.</strong>—Where wood-block pavement is laid
on streets or parts of streets having a gradient of more than 3%,
the blocks shall not be less than four (4) inches long, and the upper
side-corners of the blocks shall be chamfered to a depth of three-eighths
(⅜) inch, the chamfered surface to make an angle of 40
degrees with the vertical sides of the blocks; or such other construction
shall be used as will, in the opinion of the Engineer, provide
an equally good foot-hold for horses.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>101. Expansion Joints.</strong>—Before the blocks are set there shall
be placed along and against each curb a board of trapezoidal section
having a width one inch greater than the depth of the blocks, the
upper edge of which shall have a thickness of three-eighths (⅜)
inch for each ten feet or fraction thereof of the width of the street
between curbs, and a bottom width one-fourth (¼) inch less
than the top. The paving blocks at the beginning and end of
each course shall be set against this board. After the ramming
of the blocks has been completed, these boards shall be carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>withdrawn and the space between the curbs and the paving blocks
shall be completely filled with the bituminous paving cement
described in Section 90.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>102.</strong> The street shall not be opened to travel until such time as
the mortar under the blocks shall have become well set, nor until
the Engineer shall so direct.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>BITUMINOUS CONCRETE PAVEMENT</h3>

<p class='c006'><i>Note.</i>—The phrase, Bituminous Concrete Pavement, has been applied
to a large variety of roadway surfaces differing materially from each other
in composition, construction and utility. Some of these are covered by
United States patents, the scope and limitations of which are not yet fully
determined or understood. The necessity of avoiding infringement of
these patents has to be kept in mind in framing specifications for public
use, and this consideration does not permit the presentation here of specifications
which, in the opinion of the author, would secure an ideal pavement
of this general character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bituminous concrete pavements constructed in substantial conformity
with these specifications have been laid on a number of city and town
streets and country roads and have proved satisfactory and fairly durable
in use. It is believed that they do not infringe any existing patents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our rather limited experience with pavements of this character seems to
indicate that if good materials are used and the work properly done, they
are suitable for use on city streets of light travel, and on suburban streets
and country roads carrying an amount of travel considered heavy for
these classes of roadways. Where the results have been unsatisfactory,
the cause can generally be traced to unsuitable materials or unskillful
construction, the result of ignorance or carelessness on the one hand, or of
the attempt to reduce first cost below normal figures on the other. Many
people are searching for a pavement or roadway that will have all the good
qualities of the standard pavements but can be built about as cheaply as
a common macadam road. It is possible that something of the kind may
be discovered; but in the present state of the art it is chimerical. High
quality and low first cost do not go together in street paving. The
question to be considered is, rather, how can we invest a dollar in street
or road building so that it will, in the long run, yield the best return upon
the investment. The pavement provided for in these specifications is
not a cheap pavement, but where it is suitable for the conditions to be
met, it will be well worth its cost.</p>

inches in thickness<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and shall be composed of the materials specified
in Sects. 29, 30, and 31. The concrete shall be composed of
one part Portland cement, three parts sand and six parts of broken

<p class='c007'><strong>116. Top or Surface Course.</strong>—The top course shall be composed
of the Portland cement specified in Sect. 29, the sand specified in
Sect. 30 except that it shall be especially clean, and the grains
shall be of such size that at least seventy-five per cent. (75%) of
the mass will fail to pass a screen having thirty (30) meshes to the

fragment of stone is completely covered with mortar. Sufficient
water shall be added during the mixing, if necessary, to make a
“wet” concrete, but not so wet that free water will flow from the
mixed mass. In handling and adding the stone to the mortar
care must be taken to prevent the stone segregating into masses

so that when properly compacted its top surface will coincide with
the pavement datum. The concrete will then be well rammed by
rammers having a face of 6 by 6 inches and weighing not less than
twenty (20) pounds after which the surface will be completed by
rolling with a power roller of the asphalt type weighing not less than
five (5) tons.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> All these operations must be completed before any of
the concrete in either course shall have begun to set. The surface

<p class='c007'><strong>119.</strong> The completed surface must coincide with the pavement
datum to the extent that a properly formed template when applied
to the surface shall show no departure from the pavement datum
exceeding three-sixteenths (³⁄₁₆) inch.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>120.</strong> After the laying of the pavement has been completed it
shall be allowed to stand until the concrete of both courses shall be
fully set, which period shall be not less than ten (10) days, or longer, if
conditions make a longer time necessary, as the engineer may direct,
of which he shall be the sole judge. During this period the concrete
shall be kept in a moist condition throughout, by sprinkling with
hose or otherwise. No travel shall be allowed upon the street until
the engineer shall open it for public use. The concrete shall not
be laid during rain storms or when the thermometer is below forty-five
(45) degrees F., and in case there may be danger from frost the
whole surface of the concrete shall be covered by straw or hay.

Wherever the width of the pavement exceeds twenty (20) feet between
curbs there shall be a expansion joint along the longitudinal center
of the street; expansion joints shall also be made, at right angles to
the street and extending continuously from curb to curb, at distances
apart not exceeding twenty (20) feet. These expansion joints in the
body of the pavement shall be made by cutting entirely through both
courses of concrete along a straight line, using a special straight-edged
cutter not more than three-sixteenths (³⁄₁₆) inch thick, when
the concrete is laid in hot weather and not more than three-eighths
(⅜) inch thick if the concrete is laid when the thermometer is below
sixty (60) degrees F. The cutting of the expansion joints shall be
carefully and skillfully done, and after each joint is cut a special T-shaped
smoother, the stem of which is one inch deep and of the same
thickness as the cutter shall be worked back and forth in the joint
until the edge of the concrete adjoining the joint shall be well and
smoothly compacted. The smoother shall be so formed as to round
off the corners of the concrete to a circular form having a radius of
one-fourth (¼) inch. All these operations shall be completed
before the concrete has begun to set. After the concrete has set and
before the street is opened to travel all expansion joints shall be
poured full of bituminous cement, as specified in Section 90.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

by a finishing coat of bituminous road oil as hereinafter specified.</p>

<p class='c007'>The road oil shall be prepared from native asphalt or from a crude
oil having an asphaltic base. Not less than 95 per cent. of the oil
shall be soluble in cold carbon di-sulphide, and it shall contain not
less than thirty (30) per cent. of solid asphalt, nor more than ten per
cent. of fixed carbon. It shall be of such consistency as to flow freely
at a temperature of seventy-five degrees (75°) F. The oil shall not
be applied except when the road surface is perfectly dry and when
the temperature of the air is not below 60° F.</p>

<p class='c007'>The oil shall be evenly distributed over the whole surface of the
street at the rate of one-half (½) gallon of oil per square yard of
surface, and well worked over the surface with squeegees or other
suitable devices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not less than twenty-four hours after the application of the oil
the surface of the pavement shall be evenly covered to a depth of one-fourth

of the pavement. If contract shall be awarded under said proposal,
said specifications will be made a part of the contract entered into.
The Engineer will enforce compliance with these specifications, as
the construction work proceeds, without assuming or incurring any
responsibility for the character, quality, serviceability or durability
of the resulting pavement. But the Contractor shall be subject
to and shall comply with the requirements and stipulations of Sects.

is more or less of an experimental character, having not been heretofore
used in the city of&#160;... to an extent
sufficient to establish its value, the Contractor shall be held wholly
responsible for the utility, serviceability and durability of the pavement
so constructed; and he shall enter into a guaranty to the effect
as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>That the pavement will fulfill all the usual and legitimate requirements
of a satisfactory roadway pavement upon the street
upon which it is to be laid.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the pavement will successfully serve and endure the travel
to which the street may be subjected for a period of&#160;...
years next following the date of the certificate of its completion and
acceptance, and shall be in good condition at the end of that period,
ordinary and reasonable wear and tear, and accidental or other injuries
not due to defects in the pavement itself, excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the Contractor will, at his own cost, keep the said pavement
in satisfactory repair during said period of&#160;...
years, and will leave it in a condition of satisfactory repair at the
end of that period.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the Engineer, or his successor or successors in office, shall

proceed to make or to have made such repairs, or to repave the
street, in any manner that he may deem necessary or advisable, and
to charge the cost of such repairs or repavement to the Contractor,
provided, that the sum or sums so charged against the Contractor
shall not, in the aggregate, be more than the amount paid to the
Contractor for the construction of the pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>125. Bond.</strong>—The Contractor shall give bond with sureties satisfactory

<h3 class='c003'>HYDRAULIC CONCRETE COMBINED CURB AND GUTTER<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c006'><strong>127.</strong> Hydraulic concrete combined curb and gutter shall be constructed
in accordance with general plan No.&#160;... attached to

to the top of the curb may be varied so as to facilitate drainage.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span><strong>128. Excavation.</strong>—All excavation required for the curb and gutter
shall be completed and trimmed to the proper lines as shown by the
drawing. The drainage trench under the curb and gutter shown on
the drawing shall have the top width and general form shown in the
drawing but its depth may be varied to secure proper drainage, as
the engineer may direct, provided that its depth below the base of
the concrete shall not be less than nine inches nor more than two
feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>129. Broken Stone Drainage.</strong><a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a>—After the excavation shall have
been completed the trench shall be filled up to the level of the base
of the concrete with sound, durable broken stone, or coarse gravel,
from which the small fragments shall have been removed by screening
over a wire screen having openings not less than one inch square.
The stone or gravel shall be thoroughly tamped in the trench in
layers not more than six (6) inches thick by the use of rammers
weighing not less than thirty (30) pounds and having a face area
not exceeding thirty-six (36) square inches, and its completed top
surface shall conform truly to the designed base of the concrete.
These drains shall be connected at suitable intervals with sewers,
drains or other outlets to keep them free from standing water. The
trench filling shall be completed at least twenty-five feet in advance
of placing the forms for the concrete.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>130. Concrete.</strong><a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a>—The concrete shall be made of one (1) part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Portland cement, one and three-fourths (1¾) parts of sand and
three (3) parts of crushed stone or clean gravel. The Portland
cement shall comply in all respects with the requirements of Section
29 of these specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sand shall be clean, sharp silicious sand made up of grains
of such size that not more than fifteen per cent. (15%) will pass a
number thirty (30) sieve. It shall not contain more than five per
cent. (5%) of clay or loam nor more than two per cent. (2%) of
organic matter or other refuse. The stone shall be sound, hard,
durable, and freshly broken, free from clay, loam, organic matter,
or other impurities. Trap rock or granite will be preferred, but
limestone, if hard and sound, may be used with the approval of the
engineer. Only those fragments of the crushed stone that pass a
screen with openings three-fourths inch square and those that are
held on a screen with openings one-fourth inch square shall be used
in the concrete.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>131. Mixing and Placing Concrete.</strong>—The concrete shall be mixed
in accordance with Section 35 of these specifications. Very thorough
mixing will be required.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mixed concrete shall be handled so as to prevent as far as
practicable any separation or segregation of the stone and mortar.
When in place it shall be compacted by tamping and where placed
against forms, forking or other effective means must be used to
bring mortar to the surface and to secure complete contact between
mortar and forms, so as to leave a solid, homogeneous and unbroken
surface when the forms are removed. Where the concrete may not
be laid against forms, all exposed surfaces must be troweled to a
true surface conforming accurately to the lines shown by the plans,
templates and straight-edges being used where necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>132. Weather.</strong>—Concrete in combined curb and gutter shall
not be laid in freezing weather nor shall frozen materials be used
in the work. Completed work must be securely protected from
frost for at least seven days after it is laid. Any concrete curb
and gutter that may become frozen within that period shall be wholly
removed and replaced with new work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>133. Expansion Joints.</strong>—The combined curb and gutter shall be
divided into blocks or panels not more than twelve feet long, by
clear, open expansion joints perpendicular to the face of the curb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>extending entirely and continuously through the whole mass of
the concrete. These expansion joints shall be three-eighths inches
wide and may be formed either by cutting through the completed
curb and gutter with a suitable tool, or by the use of iron forms
or partitions, but in either case the corners at the ends of the
blocks must be made solid and dense and troweled with a suitable
tool.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>134. Circular Corners.</strong>—At the intersections of streets, circular
corners, having a radius equal, generally, to one-fifth of the width
of the roadway of the narrower street, shall be constructed of the
same dimensions and quality as on the body of the street, and the
curb and gutter will be extended along the line of the cross street
back to the front lot-lines. Properly curved circular curb and gutter
shall also be constructed at all angles exceeding five degrees in the
line of the curbing.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>135. Corner Protection.</strong>—Galvanized steel corner protectors or
nose-pieces shall be used to protect the upper and outer corner of the
curb at all circular corners and angles in the street. This steel
protection may be of any pattern or section procurable in the market
and approved by the engineer. It shall be firmly anchored and secured
into the concrete.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>136. Finishing.</strong>—After the forms have been removed and before
the concrete has set up too hard to be affected by the brush, the face
and top of the curb shall be lightly scrubbed by a suitable wire
brush so as to completely remove any glazed surface and to produce
a surface of uniform texture and appearance. Dry cement or neat
cement mortar shall not be used for dressing up exposed surfaces.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>137. Forms.</strong>—The forms used may be of dressed lumber or of
metal as the contractor may prefer. But they shall have sufficient
strength and rigidity to hold the concrete firmly in place, and to preserve
the correct dimensions, alignment and levels of the curb and
gutter.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>138. Protection.</strong>—The completed curb and gutter shall be protected
from fracture, deformation or spalling until the concrete has
fully set. The concrete must be kept moist for at least five days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>after it has been laid. Any part of the curb and gutter that shall
have become injured before it is accepted or the street is opened for
travel shall be taken up and replaced by the contractor.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>139. Payment.</strong>—Concrete combined curb and gutter will be paid
for by the linear foot in place, the measurement to be made along
the upper and outer corner of the curb. The price per linear foot
named in the contract will cover all the excavation or grading required
and all the materials and labor, including all necessary
forms, for constructing the curb and gutter complete. But the
crushed stone used for drainage will be paid for by the cubic yard
measured in place, and steel corner protection will be paid for by
the linear foot in place, at the prices named in the contract.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>HYDRAULIC CONCRETE SIDEWALKS</h3>

<p class='c006'><i>Note.</i>—These specifications conform to the common practice of laying
the sidewalk in two courses.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the author’s judgment this is neither necessary nor desirable. He
believes that it would be better and somewhat cheaper to use a single
course of concrete four inches in thickness. He suggests for this concrete
the ratios of one cement, two sand, and three and one-half stone, the latter
to be crushed to pass a screen with five-eighths inch square openings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tamping will bring a sufficient quantity of mortar to the surface to
permit of satisfactory finishing. While the materials for such a single
course of four inch concrete would cost somewhat more, the saving in
cost of labor would, at usual prices of material and labor, make the single-course
construction somewhat cheaper, while the solid four inches of
richer concrete would make the walk much stronger. In fact, a single
course of such concrete three inches thick would be sufficient in a great
majority of cases. While the surface might not have the glazed appearance
common in the two-course work it would be really better for use—a
polished and slippery surface on sidewalks is not desirable.</p>

inch openings. Crusher-run material may be used unless it contains
an excessive quantity of fine material. Gravel for the purpose may
be any sound durable gravel all of which will pass through a two inch
screen and be retained upon a one-fourth (¼) inch screen. If
cinders are used they must be good boiler-plant cinders from which
the ashes have been screened out. The cinders must be thoroughly
drenched with water at least one week before they are placed in the
sidewalk.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><strong>143.</strong> This drainage material shall be placed on the sub-grade and

up with screenings or small gravel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bottom of the drainage course shall be connected with the
street drains or sewer inlets by three-inch hard drain pipe at such
points, not more than three hundred feet apart, as will drain all
standing water out of the drainage course.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>144. Concrete, Bottom Course.</strong>—The bottom course of concrete&#160;...<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> inches in depth, shall be constructed and placed
in accordance with Sections 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36
of these general specifications, except that the maximum size of
the crushed stone shall not exceed one-half the thickness of the bottom
course of concrete and the concrete shall be uniformly composed
of one part Portland cement, three parts sand and six parts of
crushed stone. Its upper surface shall be brought to a plane parallel
to and one inch below the designed sidewalk surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>145. Surface or Finishing Course.</strong>—The surface or finishing course
shall be of concrete, one inch thick, composed of one part Portland
cement, one and one-half parts sand and two and one-half parts of
hard, durable stone, crushed to such sizes that all will pass through
a screen having openings one-half (½) inch square and none will
pass through a screen having openings one-eighth (⅛) inch square.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
This concrete shall be made as specified in Sections 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
33, 34, 35 and 36 except in the particulars named in the preceding
paragraph. Care must be taken to make the mixing very thorough.
The quantity of water used in this concrete shall be just sufficient
to make a moderately wet mixture, and care shall be taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>to make the different batches as nearly as practicable of the same
consistency.</p>

<p class='c007'>The surface concrete shall be spread over the bottom-course concrete
before the latter has begun to set,<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> properly graded, well compacted
by ramming, and its upper surface brought to the true designed
plane and surface of the sidewalk by the use of straight-edges
and troweling,<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a> after which the surface shall be lightly gone over
with a wire broom or brush to slightly roughen the surface. The
finished plane of the sidewalk shall have a transverse downward
slope toward the street of one-fourth (¼) inch to one foot of horizontal
width. At no place shall the thickness of the surface-course
be less than three-fourths of one inch. The outer top corners of the
sidewalk shall be rounded off with a suitable tool to a radius of three-fourths
(¾) inch.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>146. Forms.</strong>—Substantial and suitable forms of wood or iron
shall be furnished and used by the contractor to support the
concrete until it is hard set, when they shall be removed at his
expense.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>147. Expansion Joints.</strong>—After the laying of both courses of concrete
is completed expansion joints at right angles to the sidewalk,
and not more than four (4) feet apart shall be constructed in the sidewalk
in the following manner: the joint will be located by a line on
the surface of the sidewalk and a straight-edged cutting tool one-fourth
(¼) inch thick will be used to cut entirely through both
courses of concrete, accurately along the line marked out, entirely
across the sidewalk, after which a T-shaped trowel or tool shall be
used to smooth and compact the cut surfaces for a depth of one
inch, and to round off the corners of the sidewalk blocks to a radius
of one-fourth (¼) inch.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Where the ends of the sidewalk abut against the curbing a clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>expansion joint one and one-fourth (1¼) inches wide shall be
left between the sidewalk and the curb.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>148.</strong> After the concrete laying is completed it shall be protected
from use or injury until the concrete is set hard enough to withstand
travel, and it shall be kept continuously damp for at least five days
after the concrete is laid.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>149. Weather.</strong>—Concrete in sidewalks shall not be laid in freezing
weather nor shall frozen materials be used in the work. Completed
work must be securely protected from frost for at least seven days
after the concrete is laid. Any concrete sidewalk that shall become
frozen within that period of time shall be wholly taken up and
replaced with new work, at the expense of the contractor.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>150. Regrading.</strong>—Directly after the concrete is completed,
the forms removed, and the work inspected by the engineer, the
space between the outer edge of the sidewalk and the street curb
shall be excavated or filled up and dressed to a plane one inch
below the top of the sidewalk and the top of the street curb; and the
space on the inner side of the sidewalk shall be graded to a plane
one inch below and parallel to the surface of the sidewalk for a
distance of two feet back from the edge of the sidewalk and completed
with a slope of one and one-half to one to the natural surface
of the ground. Where this regrading requires filling up the filling
material, for a depth of four inches from the surface, shall be good,
rich surface soil.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>151.</strong> Should any defects due to faulty material or workmanship
develop in the sidewalk within one year after the completion of
the same the contractor shall repair or reconstruct all such defective
places at his expense, doing the work in accordance with these
specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>152. Measurement and Payment.</strong>—Concrete sidewalk will be
measured and paid for by the square foot of completed sidewalk
surface, and the unit price per square foot shall cover the entire
cost of the work, including grading, drainage work, all material
and labor, forms, and the regrading or dressing up after the completion
of the concrete work; except that the drain pipe used will be
paid for per linear foot at the price named in the contract which
price shall cover the cost of furnishing and putting the pipe in
place complete.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART II<br /> <span class='large'>INSTRUCTIONS TO INSPECTORS ON STREET PAVING WORK</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h3 class='c003'>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Any general code of instructions for inspectors on street paving
work must necessarily be little more than tentative or suggestive, as
applied to any one city.</p>

<p class='c007'>That here presented is intended for use in connection with the
specifications in Part I of this book. Different specifications might
make necessary many changes in the instructions that follow. The
local or special conditions in any city might also make them inapplicable
without material modifications and additions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author believes that in every city where considerable street
pavement work is prosecuted and a number of inspectors employed
on such work, some such code of instructions to inspectors should be
formulated and used. Even where the inspectors are of high character
and fully competent, the adoption of a system of rules and regulations
relating to their work will tend to unify procedure, prevent
misunderstandings and promote good discipline.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparation of such a code of instructions requires no little
time and thought, especially where there are no precedents to suggest
what is needed, or to be used as rough patterns. It is with the
hope that the code here presented may be found useful in this way,
even though it may be not appropriate for adoption in any given
city, that it is offered to municipal engineers.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>GENERAL REMARKS ABOUT INSPECTION AND INSPECTORS</h3>

<p class='c006'>The necessity of having competent and honest inspectors upon
any public work during its construction need not be here argued. It
is generally understood and recognized in the case of work carried
out by contract. Where the contractor is incompetent, careless or
unreliable, inspection is absolutely necessary if good work is to be
secured. Even where the contractor thoroughly understands his
business and intends to faithfully comply with the specifications and
to do all his work in a proper manner, the inspector cannot safely
be dispensed with. The contractor cannot at all times be on
the work; whatever may be his intention and instructions, foremen
and laborers cannot be depended upon to exercise the proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>care and judgment, even where they have no inclination, motive
or interest to do otherwise, which is not always the case. It seems
to be deeply and almost irradicably fixed in the mind of the average
foreman on municipal work that he is expected to show his ability
and skill by evading or circumventing the strict requirements of the
specifications and the watchfulness of the municipal agents, whatever
his employer may <i>say</i> to the contrary. Even when fairly careful,
honest and conscientious he may need friendly oversight. He is
naturally and properly anxious to save all the money he can for his
employer, whether from a desire to loyally serve that employer’s
interest, or to enhance his reputation for doing work cheaply. He
may not appreciate the importance of minor requirements of the
specifications and may believe they can be ignored without real
detriment to the utility of the completed work. Like other men he
may sometimes be careless or forgetful, however good his intentions.</p>

<p class='c007'>These human qualities are not confined to foremen on <i>contract</i>
work. They are liable if not likely to be found in the foremen on
work done for the municipality by the direct, or day’s work system.
They may be encouraged by the impression or belief that they will
not be held by the municipal authorities to as strict an observance or
accountability as they would be if the work were being done by a
contractor—which is too often true. The absence of some of the
motives of foremen employed by contractors is, therefore, not a
sufficient reason for dispensing with inspectors on work done by the
city direct.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be trite to say that inspectors should be chosen with
some regard to their qualifications for the work they are expected to
do. One cannot, of course, expect to secure experts for such positions
at the rate of compensation usually paid; but it is reasonable
to require that an appointee to such positions shall possess the following
qualifications:</p>

<p class='c007'>That he shall be honest, trustworthy and loyal.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he shall be a man of at least average intelligence and common
sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he shall have some practical knowledge of or experience in
the work he is employed to inspect.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he shall be a man of good personal habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>That he shall be habitually punctual, industrious, and alert, and
shall possess a fair share of that quality commonly called “backbone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It will not, I am sure, be denied that a very large number of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>inspectors found upon municipal public work fall short in one or more
of these qualifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inspectors who habitually expect or accept compensation or gratuities
from the contractor violate the first requirement, and their
number is astonishingly large. These are useless, or worse than useless,
to the municipality. There are not a few contractors who will
take advantage of the presence on the work of such inspectors to do
things that they would not do if thrown wholly on their own honor
and responsibility. Contractors can hardly be blamed for expecting
some compensation for the money thus exacted or accepted by the
inspector from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The requirement that the appointee shall have some practical
knowledge of and experience in the work he is expected to do,
while often disregarded, is of real importance. Good workmanship
embraces many small details that are essential, and inferable from
the specifications, but cannot be stated at length therein, and the
inspector should have a good working knowledge of these.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, large numbers of inspectors are employed for
personal or political reasons, or because more competent men are
not available. They know little or nothing from practical knowledge
and experience about the work they are assigned to inspect. Efficient
service cannot be expected from such, even if they possess
the other necessary qualifications. The obvious remedy, where a
sufficient number of qualified inspectors cannot be obtained at
call, would be to train up a permanent force by having the promising
tyros serve a sufficient apprenticeship under older and more experienced
inspectors; but this is seldom done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inspectors, whether appointed by the engineer in charge or not,
should be absolutely under his control, including the power of
dismissal without unnecessary formalities. Where they are under
civil service regulations and can be dismissed only upon charges
and after a hearing before some third person, the obstacles in the
way of promptly getting rid of an incompetent or unfaithful inspector
are often so great as to be discouraging if not deterrent. He may
be clearly below a reasonable standard of honesty or efficiency but
it may be very difficult to formulate distinct charges and support
them with positive evidence. Thus, one may be morally certain
that an inspector is accepting gratuities from a contractor, but
unable to prove it by legal evidence. If in such cases the judgment
and integrity of the responsible engineer cannot be trusted, he is
not fit, himself, for the position he occupies.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The question of how much authority and power shall be given
to the inspector is always a troublesome one. If he be too much
limited or restricted, he cannot properly discharge his duties or
command the necessary respect from the contractor and his employees;
if he be given too much authority and is disposed to be arbitrary
or unreasonable, the contractor may be unjustly treated. So far
as the definite requirements of the specifications are concerned there
can usually be no room for going astray, but in the numberless
little details not specifically covered in the specifications, or where
their language and intent is not clear, differences and disputes may
result which require a degree of knowledge and judgment that the
inspector may not possess, and where his decisions might be against
the interests of the municipality or unjust to the contractor. In
such cases the matter should always be referred to the engineer
or his assistant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where inspectors are employed upon work done directly by the
municipality the relation between them and the superintendent
or foreman should be clearly defined and understood. Briefly
stated, this relation should be the same as that between the inspector
and the contractor on contract work.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF INSPECTORS ON STREET PAVING AND INCIDENTAL WORK</h3>
<h4 class='c014'>GENERAL</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>1.</strong> The chief duty of the inspector is to see that the work to which
he is assigned shall be carried out in full and strict accordance with
the plans and specifications therefor, and with such additional
instructions as may from time to time be given by the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>2.</strong> These instructions are intended to supplement but in no case
to take the place of the specifications for the work, which must be
fully and strictly complied with, unless they are changed or modified
by the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>3.</strong> Wherever the words “<i>the engineer</i>” are used in these instructions
they refer to the chief engineer in charge of the work for the
municipality, or his authorized deputies or agents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wherever the words “<i>the contractor</i>” are used they refer to the
person, or firm, or corporation under contract to perform the work
to which you are assigned, or his agents or employees engaged upon
the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><strong>4.</strong> You will report to and be under the exclusive direction and
control of the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>5.</strong> Upon being assigned to any work you will obtain copies of
the plans and specifications under which it is to be done, and will
carefully read and acquaint yourself with all their provisions and
requirements. If any part of these plans and specifications are not
clearly understood by you, you will ask the engineer for explanations
and instructions, and will be governed thereby. Failure to understand
or to be familiar with the plans and specifications will in no
case be accepted as an excuse for not complying with and enforcing
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will also obtain, study and familiarize yourself with all the
blank forms, reports, etc., that are to be used by you on the work,
so that they may be correctly utilized; you will also obtain a proper
supply of such apparatus, tools, stationery, etc., as you will need
upon the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>6.</strong> In inspecting any work done under contract you are to assume
that the contractor is bound to carry out in good faith the plans and
specifications attached to his contract, and that he may be, and must
be, held to a strict compliance with them unless you receive instructions
to the contrary from the engineer. You will be held responsible
for the enforcement of these plans and specifications so far as
they relate to the doing of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>7.</strong> In case the contractor or his agents shall neglect or refuse to
comply with the plans and specifications or to perform the work in
a proper manner, or in accordance with the instructions of the engineer,
you will direct him to suspend the particular work in fault
and will report all the facts promptly to the engineer and await his
instructions, which, when received, you will proceed to enforce.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>8.</strong> You will be expected to be upon the work at all times when
work is in progress, whether during ordinary working or office hours,
or not. But in case the contractor shall work continuous day and
night forces, or otherwise so conduct the work as to require the presence
of an inspector for unusual or unreasonable hours of service,
you will notify the engineer and ask instructions or assistance. If
for any reason you are to be unable to be present whenever work is
in progress you will promptly notify the engineer in time to enable
him to supply a substitute.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>9.</strong> All reports and records required of you by the engineer must
be promptly made up and forwarded to him at the time and in the
manner he may direct. You will promptly acknowledge in person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>or writing any instructions received from the engineer and in case
such instructions are not clearly understood by you, you will ask
for explanation or advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>You will keep a notebook or diary in which all occurrences or
matters of interest relating to the work will be recorded each day,
which book will be delivered to the engineer on the completion of
the work, or whenever your connection therewith may end. All
diaries, notebooks and records kept on the work are the property
of the city.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>10.</strong> While your first duty is to see that the work is done in accordance
with the plans and specifications, you will, so far as consistent
with this duty, be considerate of the interests of the contractor and
facilitate his work as much as practicable. Materials should be
inspected promptly upon delivery and in such a manner as not to
delay or discommode the contractor more than is necessary. Errors,
defects or delinquencies in the work should be detected and called
attention to promptly, so as to avoid tearing up and re-construction
as far as practicable.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>11.</strong> Orders and instructions should be given to the contractor or
his foremen or representatives on the work and not to the laborers,
unless in urgent cases.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>12.</strong> You shall not at any time, before, during, or after the completion
of the work, ask or accept from the contractor or any of his
agents or employees, or from any other person whom you may have
reason to believe is acting for the contractor, any money, gifts,
gratuities or other considerations of value, whether as compensation
for services rendered him or otherwise. The penalty for violation
of this rule will be dismissal from the service followed by such
legal prosecution as the engineer may direct. This rule does not
apply to the ordinary small courtesies common between gentlemen
associated in business.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>13.</strong> It is a condition of your employment that your services shall
be loyal to the interests of the municipality, efficient, and satisfactory
to the engineer, and that whenever in his opinion your
service falls short of this standard he may dismiss you at any time,
without previous notice.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>STREET PAVING WORK</h3>

<p class='c006'><strong>14. Sub-foundation.</strong>—The usual procedure in preparing the sub-foundation
for a pavement is:</p>

<p class='c007'>The removal of the old pavement if one exists on the street.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The setting of new or the resetting of the old curbing. (If concrete
combined curb and gutter is used it is not constructed until
after the rough grading is done.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The rough grading of the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fine grading of the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this work the main things for the inspector to look after are
the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>If an old pavement is to be taken up and any part of it is to be
reserved for use by the city, see that the material is not injured in
handling and is disposed of as the specifications or the instructions
of the engineer require.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>15. Curbing.</strong>—New curb stone should be inspected as soon as
practicable after it is delivered on the street so that the contractor
may have time to replace any that may be rejected. Rejected
stones should be plainly marked on their tops with red paint, and
the contractor required to remove them from the street. Stones
that are defective in dressing should be given some distinctive mark
and the attention of the contractor called to them so that the
necessary redressing may be done well in advance of the setting,
and reinspected.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the old curb stone is to be redressed and reset, it should be
inspected as soon as possible after it is taken out and all stones that
are not suitable for re-use rejected and removed from the work.
The redressing of the stones should be looked after carefully. The
tendency in this work is toward the use of old stones that do not,
or cannot be made to comply with the specifications, and toward
laxity in the dressing.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Setting Curbing.</strong>—In the setting of curbing the points to be
looked after are:</p>

<p class='c007'>To see that the trenches are excavated to the full dimensions so
as to provide space for the use of the full quantity required of concrete,
gravel or broken stone in which the curb is to be embedded.</p>

<p class='c007'>To see that the stones are set to true grade and alignment.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the concrete, gravel or crushed stone used is of the proper
quality, the proper quantity used, and that it is placed and compacted
so as to fill the spaces designated under and around the
stone. The tendency of the workmen is to treat these details as
unimportant and to slight the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the curbing is set any spaces between it and the edge of the
sidewalk are to be cleaned out, filled and trimmed with Portland
cement mortar.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span><strong>16. Rough Grading.</strong>—If plows and scrapers are used in the rough
grading, see that they are not allowed to penetrate or to disturb
the natural soil below the true grade, and to prevent this it is better
to require that the plowing and scraping shall not approach nearer
than one or two inches to the true grade.</p>

<p class='c007'>If embankment or filling is necessary, the filling material must
be deposited in regular layers not more than six inches deep and
each layer must be well compacted by rolling or ramming before
the next layer is applied.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>17. Fine Grading.</strong>—The fine grading (with pick or mattock and
shovel), to bring the sub-grade to the true grade and contour required,
should be done with reasonable accuracy and care. Allowance
must be made for compression under the roller, so that when
completed the surface shall not vary more than half an inch below
nor more than a quarter of an inch above the true grade, in order
that room for the full thickness of concrete foundation may be provided,
and no more. Humps, depressions and irregularities of the
surface are to be avoided. The fine grading will be completed by
thoroughly rolling or tamping the surface to make the soil firm and
dense. On some soft or wet, clayey soils, excessive rolling may produce
a plastic or “liver-like” condition and the rolling should be
discontinued where such a tendency appears.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>18. Work Incidental to Grading.</strong>—Where it is a part of the contractor’s
work to reconstruct or readjust catch basins, manholes,
covers, and other structures, he should be required to keep this
work done well in advance of the laying of the concrete foundation.
If this work is delayed until after the main body of the concrete
is in place, leaving openings to be filled later, hurriedly and
perhaps carelessly, it may result in weak patches in the concrete
around these structures, where, in fact, the concrete should be
strongest.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>19.</strong> The concrete foundation of a pavement is a most important
part of the work, and must not be slighted in any way.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>20. Quality of Materials.</strong>—The quality of the materials used for
making the concrete are fully described in the specifications, and they
must be substantially and uniformly adhered to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Portland cement delivered on the street will presumably have
been previously inspected and accepted by the engineer, but any
change in the kind, or brand, or apparent quality of the cement delivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>after the beginning of the work should not be permitted without
the approval of the engineer. Barrels or bags of cement not
plainly marked with the brand, or name of the manufacturer must be
rejected. You will frequently make balls of stiff mortar from the
cement and sand used (1 part cement, 2 parts sand) and set them
aside for observation. If in eight hours these balls do not set up
hard the fact should be promptly reported to the engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sand and stone will naturally vary slightly from time to time,
but should not differ materially from the requirements of the specifications
or the standards adopted by the engineer. Stone or gravel
that contains any considerable quantity, say more than 5%, of
foreign matter, such as soil or refuse, should be rejected. Stone
containing an excessive quantity of fine fragments or screenings
bunched together in the pile, should be mixed with the mass of
larger stone before it is used, so as to produce a mass of fairly even
composition. Stone that is coated with mud, or that is not sound
and hard should be thrown out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sand that is moderately coarse and does not contain more than
7½% of clay or soil, and is free from vegetable refuse, may be used.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>21. Storing Materials.</strong>—Cement stored on the street must be
stacked up on dry lumber floors at least four inches from the ground
and effectually covered to protect it from rain or snow. Packages of
cement which, when turned out for use contain hard lumps should be
rejected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sand and stone must be stored on tight lumber floors to prevent
their admixture, when being shoveled up, with street soil or other
impurities. This requirement must be enforced.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>22. Proportioning Concrete.</strong>—The proportions of cement, sand
and stone or gravel named in the specifications must be strictly
adhered to.</p>

<p class='c007'>A barrel of Portland cement will be considered as four cubic
feet and a standard bag of cement as one cubic foot.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is usual for the contractor to measure the sand and stone by
wheelbarrow loads. In that case you will measure and determine
the capacity, in cubic feet, of the convenient or average wheelbarrow
load, and determine the size and number of loads each of sand and
stone required for one batch of concrete (if made by hand) and thereafter
see that the quantities thus determined are used, and the wheelbarrow
loading uniform. To measure the contents of a wheelbarrow
load, use a square box holding one cubic foot. It cannot be
accurately measured on the barrow.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>As a check upon the proportioning of materials, you should occasionally
keep a record of the quantities of cement, sand and stone
used for, say, one or two hours, and mark and measure up the quantity
of concrete made with them, and from this data compute the
ratios of the materials used. (In ordinary street concrete, proportioned
1:3:6, the volume of rammed concrete made will just about
equal the volume of the stone used.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Where the concrete is mixed by a machine with automatic feeding
devices, reliance must not be placed upon the machine for proper
proportioning. Frequent tests of the materials used and the volume
of concrete turned out should be made as described above, and any
necessary corrections made in the feeding devices of the machine.
This test should be made daily if practicable. The eye will usually
detect any material change in the composition of the concrete, and
whenever such changes are observed the composition ought to be at
once checked up by measurement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>23. Mixing Concrete.</strong>—See that the specifications are followed.
Use sufficient water to make what is commonly called a wet concrete
but not so wet that free water will drain from the mixed batch
before ramming. The test for proper mixing will be that all the
fragments of stone are completely covered with mortar.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>24. Placing Concrete on Street.</strong>—All concrete must be placed
and rammed before it begins to stiffen or set. Concrete should be
so handled that the mortar will segregate or separate from the
stone as little as possible. When in place on the street it should
make a mass of uniform consistency and appearance. The concrete
should, as soon as placed on the street, be graded to a proper thickness
and surface, and then well compacted by ramming. Insist
on good ramming; this part of the work is not often properly done.
The surface of the concrete should be brought to the true grade
by proper grading and tamping. Where necessary to raise the
surface, additional concrete, made of small stone, may be applied
during the tamping. Neat mortar should not be used for this
purpose. Sweeping mortar over the surface with street brooms
should not be permitted—it is useful only to cover up defects and
to produce an extra smooth surface (which is not usually desirable).
To measure the thickness of the bed of concrete, lay a straight-edge
upon the surface with the end of the straight-edge projecting a
foot or two beyond the edge of the concrete, and measure the space
from the lower edge of the straight-edge down to the sub-foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Care must be taken to finish the surface of the completed concrete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>at the proper distance below and truly parallel to the grade and contour
of the finished pavement. This is more important in the case
of sheet asphalt pavements, since irregularities in the concrete will
cause variation in the thickness of the finished asphalt surface,
which will affect the durability of the pavement. The grade
stakes for the concrete should therefore be carefully set and worked
to, and humps or depressions between the stakes should be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>25.</strong> In hot, dry, weather the concrete must be kept damp by
watering it until it is at least five days old, and horse-travel over it
must be prohibited until it has set up hard enough not to be injured
thereby.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>26. Old Paving Stone Foundations.</strong>—If a foundation is to be
made of old paving stone blocks reset, the important points to be
looked after are,</p>

<p class='c007'>The preparation of the sub-foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sand bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The setting of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The grouting of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sub-foundation should be prepared, where necessary, as
stipulated in Sects. 16 and 17 of these instructions. This part of
the work is likely to be carelessly done unless proper work is insisted
upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sand used as a cushion course must be of good quality and
reasonably clean. The use of mixed sand and soil taken from the
street excavation should not be permitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blocks, after being cleaned from adhering dirt, should be
set with reasonable care, well bedded in the sand cushion, and laid
at such an elevation below the completed pavement surface, that
after being well rammed, the surface will be at the proper elevation
below the pavement datum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The grouting of the joints is the most important part of the work.
See that the mortar is made and used in accordance with the specifications,
and that the joints are completely filled.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>27. Broken Stone Foundations.</strong>—The specifications for broken
stone foundations are sufficiently explicit, and compliance should
be insisted upon. Thorough rolling is especially important.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>SHEET ASPHALT PAVEMENTS</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>28.</strong> The manufacture of the mixture for sheet asphalt pavement,
and the laying of it on the street, involve a number of separate
elements or operations. The quality and durability of the pavement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>will depend largely upon the skill, intelligence and accuracy
with which each and all parts of the work are carried out. The
inspector, both at the mixing plant and on the street, must give
constant and intelligent attention to the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>29. Inspecting at Paving Plant.</strong>—Inspectors at the plant where
the asphalt paving mixture is made will be provided with the following
apparatus:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>nest of standard sieves, Nos. 10, 30, 50, 80, 100 and 200
    </dd>
    <dt>2</dt>
    <dd>thermometers for sand
    </dd>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>tank thermometer
    </dd>
    <dt>2</dt>
    <dd>standard flow-plates and one dozen cartridges for same
    </dd>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>balance for weighing sand
    </dd>
    <dt>6</dt>
    <dd>dishes, glass or porcelain, 4 inches in diameter.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'><strong>30.</strong> The more important things for the Plant Inspector to watch
during the manufacture of asphalt paving mixture are:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt><i>a.</i></dt>
    <dd>Quality and grading of the sand.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>b.</i></dt>
    <dd>Temperature of heated sand.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>c.</i></dt>
    <dd>Uniform quality of the refined asphalt and flux.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>d.</i></dt>
    <dd>Temperature of melted bitumens.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>e.</i></dt>
    <dd>Uniform consistency of asphaltic cement.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>f.</i></dt>
    <dd>Correct ratios of sand and asphaltic cement.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>g.</i></dt>
    <dd>Thorough mixing of materials.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'><strong>31. Sand.</strong>—The general quality and grain-size of the sand, required
by the specifications, must be closely watched and adhered to.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is hardly ever possible to secure a natural sand that will conform
strictly to the theoretical composition, but <i>substantial</i> compliance
should be required unless the Chief Engineer directs otherwise.
After any sand has been approved for a given contract or
street, all the sand thereafter used for that street should conform
closely to the standard so approved; for any material change in
the quality of the sand will change the quality of the pavement produced,
unless the proportions of the other materials are changed
accordingly. Any material change in the sand should therefore be
promptly reported to the Chief Engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>32.</strong> Sand for the sieve tests should be taken from the hot-sand
box and allowed to become cold. From the sample thus taken,
weigh out 50 grams. Arrange the nest of sieves with the No. 200
at the bottom followed by Nos. 100, No. 80, No. 50, No. 30 and
No. 10 at the top.</p>

<p class='c007'>Place the weighed sample upon the No. 10 sieve and thoroughly
shake the nest until all the sand that will, has passed through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>various sieves; then weigh the various portions, beginning with that
which has passed the No. 200 (deducting in each case the weight of
the dish). The portion <i>remaining</i> on the No. 200, is the quantity
<i>passing</i> the No. 100, etc. The sum of all these portions should be 50
grams, though it will usually be slightly less because of unavoidable
waste. In use, keep the sieves clean and as free as possible from
adhering grains by using a bristle brush.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>33. Temperature of the Sand.</strong>—The temperature of the heated
sand should be frequently noted by plunging the thermometer into
the mass. It should not fall below 315° F. nor exceed 375° F. It is
very important to avoid over-hot sand, because, in the mixer, the
very thin films of bitumen covering the hot-sand grains are readily
and quickly scorched by the excessive heat in the sand.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>34. Refined Asphalt and Fluxing Oil.</strong>—Unless otherwise notified
by the Chief Engineer you will assume that the stock of refined
asphalt on hand at the beginning of the work has been inspected and
is satisfactory. You will, however, note the appearance of the
material and the character and marking of the barrels or packages,
and will not permit the use of any new shipments of materials of
different appearance or brand without authority from the Chief
Engineer. The above instructions apply also to the oil used for
fluxing.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>35. Ratio of Asphalt and Flux.</strong>—You will frequently note and
record the weight of asphalt and of flux used in charging the melting
tanks.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>36. Temperature in Melting Tanks.</strong>—The melting kettles are
usually equipped with fixed thermometers, but their reading should
be frequently checked with your detached tank thermometer. You
will see that the temperatures in the kettles are kept within the limits
named in the specifications. See that the melted asphaltic cement
is kept constantly agitated as required by the specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>37. Uniformity of Asphaltic Cement.</strong>—It is very important that
the asphaltic cement shall be of uniform composition and consistency,
or hardness.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the composition and consistency of the asphaltic cement to
be used for the surface-course of any street has been determined
upon and approved by the engineer, you will take out and preserve
a sufficiently large quantity to be used thereafter as a standard, and
each subsequent tank of cement, before it is used, should be tested
by comparing it with this standard in the following manner, using
the flow-plate apparatus:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Melt and fill two cartridges with the standard cement, and two
with the cement to be tested, marking them for identification.
When cold, carefully remove with a wetted dull knife any surplus
cement from the ends of the cartridges so as to leave them exactly
full and the metal ends clean. Immerse them in cold water until
they are all of the same temperature. Then place and fasten these
filled cartridges on the grooved plate with their lower ends exactly
to the zero line on the plate, the standard samples alternating with
the new. Then place the plate, at an inclination of about 45°, in
front of a source of uniformly distributed heat, as, for instance, near
a steam boiler or large steam pipe, or (when the weather is favorable)
in the sunshine, facing the sun. Leave the plate in this position until
the bitumen in the cartridges shall have melted and flowed down
the grooves an average of from four to five inches. Then measure
the lengths of flow of each from the zero line on the plate. If the
average flow of the new samples differs more than 5 per cent. from
that of the standards, the new cement should be regarded as unsatisfactory
and should be corrected by adding more asphalt or flux,
as may be required.</p>

<p class='c007'>(If a <i>penetration apparatus</i> is supplied or is available, the penetration
method may be used instead of this flow-method for determining
the consistency of the cements. Proper instructions for
its use will accompany the apparatus.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>38. Ratio of Sand and Cement.</strong>—When the proper ratio of sand
and asphaltic cement has been determined for any street you will
see that this ratio is carefully adhered to. The correctness of the
weighing scales used should be frequently tested.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>39. Mixing.</strong>—When the sand and asphaltic cement are properly
mixed the appearance of the mass will be perfectly uniform throughout,
with every grain of sand entirely and evenly coated with cement.
The mixing should, however, be continued somewhat beyond the
attainment of this condition, so as to insure thoroughness. After
the proper result has been arrived at, either the <i>time</i> in the mixer,
or the <i>number of revolutions</i> of the mixer shaft should be noted and
the standard thus determined substantially adhered to thereafter.
With the standard mixers commonly used, the hot sand and the
filler (dust) should first be put into the mixer and mixed for about
fifteen seconds; then the asphaltic cement added and the mixing
continued as long as necessary (in the usual mixer not less than sixty
seconds).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>40. Records.</strong>—You will keep complete records of the results of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>your observations and tests in a book which will be provided for the
purpose, and will make such reports to the Engineer as he may direct.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>41. Inspection on the Street.</strong>—The leading things to be kept in
mind by the street inspector, in the laying of asphalt pavement on
the street, are the following:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt><i>a.</i></dt>
    <dd>Temperature of mixtures when applied to the street.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>b.</i></dt>
    <dd>Proper preparation of the street surface before material is laid.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>c.</i></dt>
    <dd>Laying and rolling of the binder-course.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>d.</i></dt>
    <dd>Laying of the surface-course.
    </dd>
    <dt><i>e.</i></dt>
    <dd>Rolling the surface-course.
    </dd>
    </dl>
<p class='c007'><strong>42. Inspector’s Equipment.</strong>—The inspector will be supplied with
the following apparatus:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>armored thermometer reading from 200° F. to 500° F.
    </dd>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>graduated spatula.
    </dd>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>twelve-foot straight-edge.
    </dd>
    <dt>1</dt>
    <dd>fifty-foot tape line.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'><strong>43. Temperature of Mixture.</strong>—If proper care has been taken at
the mixing plant the mixture will not arrive on the street at too high
a temperature, and your principal care will be to see that it is not
laid at too low a temperature. The minimum temperature named
in the specifications should be adhered to. While the main or interior
mass of a wagon load may be well above that temperature, the top
and outer part of the load may be, particularly in cold weather, too
cold to be safely used. Some of this colder portion may usually be
sufficiently reheated by mixing it with the hotter material, if properly
handled in unloading; but any material that is so cold as to be
lumpy when unloaded, or, more particularly, when being raked out,
should be discarded. This applies to both surface and binder
mixtures.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must not, however, be overlooked that the different kinds
of asphalts have different appropriate working temperatures, and
for some asphalts the minimum temperature named in the specifications
may be too low. The best practical guide is the manner in
which the mixture behaves in raking. It must always be so hot
that it will, under the rake, break up into a uniform, crumbling
or powdery mass. If it does not do this it is (unless the mixture is
excessively rich in bitumen or improperly compounded) too cold.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>44. Preparation of Street Surface.</strong>—Before the binder-course is
laid, all loose material, rubbish, street dirt and other matter foreign
to the concrete surface must be removed and the concrete surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>swept, if necessary, to properly clean it, with street brooms. Neither
binder nor surface mixture shall be laid upon wet surfaces. Before
the spreading of the surface mixture on the binder the latter must
be cleaned of all foreign matter and, if necessary, swept. If the
binder is covered with mud from wagons or other travel, the surface
must be scrubbed clean. Any part of the binder-course that may
have become broken or loosened before the surface-course is applied
must be taken up and new material laid in its place with the same
care as the original.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>45. Laying Binder-course.</strong>—The binder mixture must be carefully
spread and raked to such thickness that after being rolled
it will present an even, true surface not varying more than one-fourth
inch from the intended finished surface of the binder. The
tendency is to lay the binder-course carelessly and to roll it insufficiently.
Nearly the same care in raking and rolling as for the
surface-course, should be insisted upon. If the binder is not thoroughly
compressed before it becomes cold it is likely, in future hot
weather, to soften and yield under heavy travel and thus to start
depressions in the pavement which will increase with time.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>46. Laying the Surface-course.</strong>—The requirements of the specifications
should be rigidly enforced in the laying of the surface-course.
Joints against a cold edge of previously laid surface must be cut
back until solid, fully compressed material of full thickness is reached,
and the raw edge completely but thinly painted with liquid paving
cement or pitch. No masses or fragments of cold mixture, whether
of binder or surface, must be allowed to remain on the surface of
the binder in advance of the placing of the surface-course, to be
covered up by the latter. Such cold masses will not be compressed
by the roller, but will later, under a hot sun and heavy travel,
yield and start depressions in the pavement. The raking out
requires to be properly and skilfully done. The tines of the rakes
must penetrate to the binder, so that the raked material will be a
uniform mass from top to bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>47. Rolling.</strong>—You will insist upon the rollers being placed upon
the freshly raked surface just as soon as the material will bear them
without being squeezed out or displaced laterally. The tendency
is to keep the rollers off too long, thus permitting the chilling of
the surface and preventing its proper compression. Do not take
the contractor’s word as to how soon the rolling may be begun,
but have trials made until you are able yourself to judge. The
rolling by the heavy roller should be very thorough: keep the roller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>at work constantly until the surface is too cold to be impressed.
In operating the roller lengthwise of the street begin at the gutters
and work toward the center of the street. Cross rolling and diagonal
rolling must be insisted upon wherever the width of the street will
permit it.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>48. Proper Thickness and Surface.</strong>—While the completed surface
is still warm enough to permit it, measure the thickness of the
surface-course by forcing the graduated spatula through it to the
binder and noting the depth of penetration. Also test the trueness
of the finished surface with the straight-edge, and if found defective
in either thickness of pavement or trueness of surface, insist on more
careful grading and raking on the further work. Try the completed
gutters with water to see that they are so truly laid that puddles
of water will not stand in them.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>49.</strong> Asphalt surface must not be laid when rain or snow is falling,
or so long as the street surfaces are wet. Surface mixture raked out
and caught in a shower before it is well enough rolled to exclude
water must be taken up and discarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unless unavoidable, neither binder nor surface should be laid
when the street surface or the air is below 40° F. As a rule, the lower
the temperature the of air the greater is the care necessary to properly
lay asphalt pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>50.</strong> Measure each day the area of pavement laid and record
that, and the quantity (number of batches) of surface mixture used,
and note any lack of uniformity in the area laid per batch.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>ASPHALT BLOCK PAVEMENT</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>51.</strong> You may assume, unless otherwise instructed, that the
Engineer has inspected and approved the general character of the
blocks already delivered for the work, unless their inferiority be
obvious, but you will be expected to observe them carefully as laid
and to reject blocks that vary in dimensions from those permitted by
the specifications, and those that are broken, disfigured or injured.
But during the progress of the work you will note the character of
subsequent deliveries and report to the Engineer any apparent change
in the quality of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more important points to look after in the laying of the
asphalt blocks are: the quality and grading of the mortar bed in
which the blocks are set, and the care and accuracy of the block
setting. The mortar must be of cement and sand in the ratios specified,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and sufficient water used to make a medium stiff mortar; the use of
merely moistened powder must not be permitted; and any mortar
that has begun to set up before the blocks are laid and rammed must
be discarded.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>52.</strong> In setting the blocks the principal requisites are: that they be
well bedded in the mortar; that they be set so that after ramming their
tops will be accurately in the pavement datum; that they be set and
pressed as closely together as possible, levers or mauls being used to
force them into close contact, both at ends and sides.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>GRANITE BLOCK PAVING</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>53.</strong> Assuming that the foundation has been properly constructed,
the more important things for the inspector to look after are:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>a.</i> The quality and shape of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>b.</i> The sand cushion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>c.</i> The setting of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>d.</i> The ramming of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>e.</i> The filling of the joints.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>54. The Blocks.</strong>—Assuming that the general <i>quality</i> of the granite
has been approved, you will need only to observe and reject blocks
made from soft or weathered or otherwise defective stone. Any
material divergence of the blocks from the correct form or from the
sizes specified as permissible will be readily caught by the eye as they
are brought to the street, and they can then be thrown out. The
proper dressing of the blocks is important and should be watched
carefully. While you are not expected to examine each individual
block, close observation of the blocks as they are handled and laid
will enable you to detect and reject those that are materially defective
in shape or dressing; or excessively wide joints will call attention
to these defects as the blocks are set.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>55. Sand Cushion.</strong>—The sand used for the cushion bed should be
moderately coarse and must be fairly clean and pure. The tendency
with contractors is to use any dirty sand or sandy loam available on
the street. Such material, especially if it becomes filled with water,
will yield under the blocks and will not support them properly. The
sand bed should not vary materially in thickness. It should be laid
and graded not more than fifty nor less than twenty feet in advance
of the setting of the blocks.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>56. Setting of the Blocks.</strong>—The blocks should be delivered in
front of the block setters on the blocks already set. The blocks
must be set in straight courses from curb to curb, the courses running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>at right angles to the street (except at street intersections). All
the blocks in any one course must be of the same width. Each block
should be so set that the whole of its bed will be seated upon sand.
The usual practice of block setters is to make a bed by drawing the
sand into a small ridge upon which the outer edge of the block is
rested, its weight canting it against the course already laid. This
usually leaves a cavity under the back edge of the block which neither
the subsequent joint filling or ramming closes up, so that the block
may rest permanently on only a part of its bed. The practice is so
fixed with block setters that it will require firmness and persistency
to prevent it, but you should insist that it be so modified as to give
a solid bearing for each block over its whole base.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blocks must be set solidly against each other so as to make
the joints of the least possible width. Unless close attention is
given to this the joints are likely to greatly exceed the width permitted
by the specifications. Care should be taken that the blocks
are set truly vertical so that their upper face shall be parallel to the
plane of the street. In setting the blocks their straightest and
truest face should be placed upward so as to make the surface of the
pavement as smooth and even as possible. Block setters are often
careless about this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ordinarily no grade stakes are set for the surface of the pavement
and templates are seldom used, the block setters using only their eyes
to make the surface conform to the intended contour of the street.
This usually results in the completed street being more or less wavy
and irregular, and in a lack of regular and uniform cross-section in
different parts of the street, often very perceptible to the eye.
Care should be taken to avoid this as much as possible. Straight-edges
and templates, cut to the proper curve for the surface, should
be provided and used.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>57. Ramming the Blocks.</strong>—This part of the work is likely to
be slighted unless carefully watched. The important thing is to
have each block equally and sufficiently rammed to bring it to a
firm bearing on the sand, as well as to bring its top to the proper
grade. The rammers will be disposed to touch lightly blocks or
areas which if thoroughly rammed would be driven below the true
surface of the pavement, and subsequent travel may force these
down, making depressions in the surface. It is a very common
practice for the men working the rammers to shirk on this work by
allowing the rammers to fall with little more force than that due to
their own weight. This should be detected and remedied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span><strong>58. Filling the Joints.</strong>—The specifications are quite full and clear
regarding this part of the work and little further need be said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Care is necessary, whether the joints be filled with gravel and
bituminous cement or with grout, to secure the complete filling of
all the joints. If the weather is cold at the time the work is done,
the gravel filling may become so chilled before the bituminous
cement is poured that it will not flow to the bottom of the joints.
For this reason it is important that the cement be worked at the
highest temperature that it will bear without injury.</p>

<p class='c007'>If grout filling is used care is necessary to make the mortar of
the right consistency. If too thick it will not flow freely to the bottom
of the joint; if too thin its strength will be materially reduced.
Experiments should be made to determine the proper consistency,
and when this is found, the quantity of water used in making the
mortar should be determined and thereafter measured out for each
batch.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mortar must be kept constantly stirred until used, otherwise
the sand is likely to settle to the bottom. Whatever filling is used,
a second and sometimes a third pouring will be necessary to completely
fill the joints.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>BRICK PAVEMENT</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>59.</strong> The matters requiring most attention in the construction of
brick pavement (assuming that the foundation is in place) are the
character and quality of the brick, the sand cushion, the setting of
the brick, and the filling of the joints between the brick.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>60. Inspecting the Brick.</strong>—The examination, testing and acceptance,
in a general way, of the brick to be used for the work will
be made in the engineer’s office, and your duty will be confined in
this matter to seeing that the brick delivered and used are in accordance
with the standard established and the general requirements
of the specifications. You can best inspect the brick as they are
being laid or after they have been laid, and before the surface has
been rammed or rolled. Presumably the brick-setters will discard
most of the unsuitable brick during the progress of their work,
particularly if they are given to understand distinctly the defects
that will cause rejection.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the setting is completed, go carefully over the surface of the
pavement and mark plainly all the bricks that are to be removed
for defects and see that all such are taken out and replaced with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>good brick. The principal defects that should be observed are:
soft or underburned bricks; those that are warped or deformed
so that they will not fit closely to their neighbors, or have warped
or ill-shaped tops; those that are broken or chipped or show injurious
cracks, and those that are perceptibly wider or narrower than their
neighbors in the same course.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soft or underburned brick may be detected with most certainty
by having the contractor wet the surface of the pavement by
sprinkling. The soft brick will absorb more water and remain
damp longer than the hard brick and can thus be readily detected.
This test can be applied, however, only to pavements the joints of
which are to be filled with grout, as bituminous filling should not
be applied to brick with wet surfaces, and to wait until they become
dry after the wetting would delay the work unwarrantably.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>61. Sand Cushion.</strong>—See that the sand used is free from foreign
matter and pebbles, as required by the specifications, and that the
sand bed is of uniform thickness, correctly gaged, and rolled to the
true plane of the pavement, additional sand being added or surplus
removed where necessary to secure this result. See that the cushion
is not thereafter disturbed or, if disturbed, that it be restored to
its original condition.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>62. Setting the Brick.</strong>—The bricks are to be set as closely together
as possible both at sides and ends, so that the joints will not be wider
than permitted by the specifications. Where the bricks have lugs
or letters on one side, the lug-sides shall in no case be laid together.
The courses must be reasonably straight entirely across the street.
See that the bricks in adjoining courses break joint not less than
three inches. Brick-setters are likely to be careless about this.
Do not permit bats to be used except where necessary at the ends
of courses or to fit the pavement against street railroad rails or around
manholes or other structures in the street, and insist that this
filling in shall follow immediately after the brick-setting, and that
close fits shall be made.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>63. Rolling the Pavement Surface.</strong>—This should be carefully
and uniformly done so as to insure the even surface and contour
of the pavement. Do not allow the roller to make sharp turns
on the freshly laid brick surface as it will disturb and cant the
loose brick. The roller should run back onto the fully completed
pavement to make any necessary turns or considerable changes of
direction. Quick starts or stops of the roller on the fresh-laid brick
should be avoided for the same reason.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><strong>64. Filling the Joints.</strong>—Whether grout or bituminous filling be
used the important thing is to get all the joints completely filled.
Where bituminous cement is used, if the work is done in very cool
weather the brick is likely to chill the cement before it reaches the
bottom of the joints unless the cement be applied as hot as possible
without injuring it, and the pouring be rapidly and carefully done.</p>

<p class='c007'>If grout filling be used, see that the mortar is made of the proper
ratio of sand and cement and that it is of the proper consistency
to just flow into the joints, and that after mixing it is kept stirred
until used. Repour all joints where necessary to completely fill
them.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>65. Gutters and Expansion Joints.</strong>—See that the gutters are laid
with longitudinal courses of brick and their joints filled with bituminous
cement as provided in the specifications.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>WOOD-BLOCK PAVEMENT</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>66. Foundation.</strong>—The instructions relating to the preparation of
the sub-foundation and the concrete foundation already given apply
to wood-block pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>67. Inspection of Blocks.</strong>—However carefully the lumber may have
been inspected before its manufacture into blocks, the subsequent
seasoning, treatment, handling and exposure to the weather will
develop many defects and you will need to observe the delivered
blocks closely, either before or after they are set, and reject those
that do not comply with the specifications. The principal defects
that you will be able to detect after the blocks are treated are the
following: Southern pine blocks made of second-growth or inferior
wood, partly shown by the number of annual growth rings per inch.
Blocks having a less number of these annual growth rings per inch
than is permitted by the specifications should be rejected. The
treated blocks, especially when they are exposed to the weather for
some time, are likely to develop seasoning cracks, “shakes” and loose
knots, not observable in the lumber, and blocks showing these to an
injurious extent should be rejected, though in many cases the defective
part may be split off and the remainder of the block used for
closers. If the blocks have become very dry and thoroughly seasoned
out, they should be well sprinkled with water about twenty-four
hours before they are to be set, to forestall excessive swelling and
“humping” when a rain storm comes upon the new pavement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>68. Mortar Bed.</strong>—It is the common practice in preparing the mortar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>for the mortar bed under the blocks to simply dampen the mixed
sand and cement so that it may still be spread and handled like damp
sand. See that sufficient water is used to make a moderately stiff
mortar, suitable for being worked with a trowel. This mortar should
be prepared in sufficiently small quantities at a time to insure that
it will not begin to set before the blocks be placed in it and rammed.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>69. Setting the Blocks.</strong>—The setting of the wooden blocks is a
comparatively simple operation and the specifications are sufficiently
full and clear for your guidance. See that the blocks are so set that
their tops, after the ramming is completed, shall be truly in the pavement
datum, without humps or depressions.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>70. Filling the Joints.</strong>—See that the sand used is perfectly dry,
fine and clean, and that it is swept about on the pavement until the
joints are completely filled.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>BITUMINOUS CONCRETE PAVEMENT</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>71. Preparation of Foundation.</strong>—Where a bituminous concrete
wearing surface is to be placed upon an old pavement or Macadam
road the specifications must be closely followed. A good foundation
is as necessary, if good results are to be attained, as in the case of
other pavements. The dressing down of high points and the filling
up of depressions in the old pavement should be carefully done, so
that the bituminous wearing surface shall be of uniform thickness,
and shall be rigidly supported at all points.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>72. Bituminous Concrete Surface.</strong>—The instructions given for
the manufacture and laying of sheet asphalt pavement should be
followed here insofar as they are applicable.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>HYDRAULIC CONCRETE ROADWAY PAVEMENT</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>73.</strong> Like other structures made of hydraulic concrete, the utility
and durability of concrete roadway pavement depends largely upon
the good quality of the materials used and the skill and fidelity with
which the work is done. It is especially important that the second,
or surface, course of the concrete shall be made and placed in strict
accordance with the specifications and that a high degree of <i>uniformity</i>
shall be secured in the composition, consistency and workmanship
of that part of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>74. Sub-foundation and Foundation.</strong>—The preparation of the sub-foundation
will be the same as for other pavements, and the first, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>foundation course, of concrete, will be constructed as in the case of
the concrete foundation for other pavements.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>75. Material for Surface-course.</strong>—It may be assumed that, in
general, the materials intended to be used on the work have been
inspected and approved by the Engineer, but this should not prevent
you from calling his attention to any defective or inferior materials
that may be delivered on the street when the work is begun, or
thereafter, and preventing the use of any materials that are not fully
up to the requirements of the specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>76. Mixing the Surface Course.</strong>—See that the cement sand and
stone are proportioned accurately and that the quantity of water
used with each batch is measured, so as to make the concrete of
uniform consistency. Do not permit any defective batches of concrete
to be used in the surface-course—if suitable for the bottom
course they may be used in it. Care in this respect is particularly
necessary with machine-mixed concrete where the machine is not
working normally or the men operating it are careless or unskillful.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>77. Placing Surface Course Concrete.</strong>—See that the surface
course is placed, graded and rammed <i>before the bottom course concrete
begins to set</i>. This is imperative. Also that the concrete is distributed
and graded in such a way as will not separate or segregate
the mortar from the stone; that the grading of the surface is so accurate
that it will not be necessary later to add additional concrete
to that already graded and rammed; that the ramming is thorough
and uniform over the whole surface, and that the rolling is well
done.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>78. Expansion Joints.</strong>—Care should be taken to have the expansion
joints made as the specifications require. See that they extend
entirely through both courses of concrete; that the corners are properly
compacted and troweled; that the joints are kept clean until
they are filled with the bituminous cement, and are completely
filled with the cement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>79. Care of Finished Work.</strong>—Do not permit the completed work
to be disturbed by travel over it, and see that the concrete is kept
moist, until it shall be set up hard, and that the street is not opened
for travel until the engineer so directs.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>CONCRETE COMBINED CURB AND GUTTER</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>80. General.</strong>—The specifications for the construction of Hydraulic
Concrete Combined Curb and Gutter are quite full and clear and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>duty of the inspector will consist mainly in seeing that they are
faithfully carried out.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>81. Concrete.</strong>—As in other concrete construction, the utility of
the work depends largely on the care and skill with which the concrete
is made and placed. See that the prescribed quality and ratio
of materials are used and that the concrete is thoroughly mixed
and properly placed in the forms and well tamped. Especial care
is necessary to secure a continuous and satisfactory exposed surface
by forking and working the mortar into contact with the forms,
which must be placed and maintained in true line and surface.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Concrete Combined Curb and Gutter</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>82. Removing Forms.</strong>—Good judgment is required as to the
proper time to remove the forms. They must remain until the
concrete has set hard enough to be fully self-sustaining, but before
it has set so hard that the wire brush will have no effect on the
surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>83. Corner Protection.</strong>—See that the metallic corner or nose
piece is correctly placed and that it is solidly anchored by and fully
embedded in the body of the concrete.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span><strong>84. Patching.</strong>—The practice of patching up cavities or irregularities
in the exposed face of the curb and gutter with neat mortar,
or dressing the surface with dry cement, must not be permitted.
If a section of the curb is found, when the forms are removed, to be
imperfect, the whole section must be removed and replaced.</p>

<h4 class='c014'>HYDRAULIC CEMENT SIDEWALKS</h4>

<p class='c015'><strong>85. General.</strong>—While the work of constructing concrete sidewalk
is comparatively simple it is often carelessly and unskillfully
done. The things that need most attention by the inspector are the
following:</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>86. Materials.</strong>—The materials used in the work must be fully
up to the quality called for by the specifications. This applies
more particularly to the cement and sand. These are not always
properly tested by the engineer and you should frequently make
samples of stiff mortar (1 cement, 2 sand) and set them aside for
observation. If they do not, in summer weather, become very
hard at the end of nine hours, the fact should be reported to the
engineer.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>87. Drainage.</strong>—See that the necessary grading is properly done
and that the drainage course is made of suitable material properly
compacted. See that drain tiles are properly laid and connected
as designed by the engineer. If cinders are used for the drainage
course, see that they are screened to remove ashes and fine material,
and that they are thoroughly drenched with water at least five
days before they are placed in the walk.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>88. Two-course Work.</strong>—If the sidewalk is laid in two courses,
see that the surface-course is put on and tamped before the bottom-course
concrete has begun to set. This requirement must be strictly
enforced.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>89. Finishing the Surface.</strong>—Dry or pure cement must not be
used for trimming up or smoothing off the surface of the walk.
After the surface has been properly completed by straight-edge
and trowel, see that the wire broom is used as directed to remove
the glaze and to slightly roughen the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'>See that the expansion joints are made as specified, and that they
extend entirely through both courses of concrete.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>90.</strong> See that the walk, after completion is properly protected
from injury and from frost, and that the concrete is kept moist
until it becomes well set.</p>

<hr class='c022' />
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. In specifications to be used in any particular city the official name of the
city government, as the City Council, the Commissioners of Public Works,
etc., should be used instead of this general designation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Such a proviso as this seems proper in justice to both the city engineer and
the contractor; the former should not be held responsible for the acts of his
assistants when they transcend the authority conferred upon them, and the
latter should be put upon his guard with reference to requirements which he is
not satisfied are sanctioned or approved by the city engineer.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. It may be objected that this requirement is unusual and unnecessary, since
such practices are recognized as wrong, and as presumptive of fraud and malpractice
on the part both of the contractor and the inspector. It cannot, however,
be denied that in many cities such means are employed by contractors to
unduly influence the action of inspectors and that not infrequently the latter not
only accept, but persistently demand, valuable considerations from the contractor.
Silence of the specifications on this point cannot, of course, be construed
into consent, but there is no good reason for the silence. There should
be left no excuse for misconception of the position of the city or of the engineer
upon this point.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. This section is intended as much for the control and limitation of city
officials as of contractors. The practice of carelessly or purposely allowing
municipal contracts to be expanded greatly beyond the stated limits or the
original intended volume and cost without formal authorization by the proper
municipal body in which the power to make contracts is lodged, is dangerous
and wrong and should be prohibited. In one instance coming to the notice of
the author a contract originally intended to cover $50,000 worth of work was
expanded by the department head without any authority from the city council
until the final estimate reached the enormous sum of over $400,000.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. As outlined in the introduction, these specifications are designed to secure
the construction of the pavement in a proper manner, the city assuming responsibility
for the character and utility of the work. The guarantee here proposed is
therefore intended to cover only a proper compliance with the specifications, for
which the contractor may properly be held responsible, and not the sufficiency
or utility of the work, if constructed according to the specifications. The period
of guaranty should therefore be short, not exceeding two years.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. In the great majority of cases the most satisfactory and, in the end, the
most economical foundation for a pavement is hydraulic cement concrete. Old
paving-block foundation, if constructed as specified in Sect. 36, will give results
equally as satisfactory, but if a fair market exists for the blocks taken up from
the street, it will usually be found more economical to sell them and construct
a concrete foundation for the new pavement. Broken stone or gravel foundations
may serve the purpose fairly well upon a street of light travel, but it should
never be used on streets of considerable or heavy travel. Its lower first cost is
the only thing in its favor, but this will, in nearly every case, be more than offset
by the better service and greater durability of the pavement, even on streets of
light travel, if laid upon an adequate hydraulic concrete foundation. Proper
repairs to pavement surfaces cut into for pipe work, etc., are difficult to make
and hardly ever satisfactory over broken stone foundation for the reason that
the lack of cohesion in the material allows it to loosen or crumble away from
under the edge of the pavement surface, and it is difficult to restore it to its
original solidity and strength. The first cost saved by its use is usually not
great; for whenever its use would be permissible at all, a comparatively thin and
lean concrete would give better results, at a very slight increase in cost. To
illustrate: On a suburban street with light travel a concrete foundation four
inches in thickness, the concrete made with Portland cement in the ratio of 1
cement, 4 sand, and 8 stone, would be stronger and in every way better than a
foundation eight inches in depth of broken stone. At the usual prices of materials
and labor, the former may cost about $0.46 per sq. yd., and the latter about
$0.40 per sq. yd.; but for the latter there would be required ⅑ cu. yd. more
sub-foundation excavation, worth about four cents, so that the equivalent cost
would be $0.44 per sq. yd. The difference, two cents per sq. yd., is insignificant
when compared with the greater value, better service, and greater durability of
a pavement on the concrete foundation. It is sometimes held that the broken
stone foundation provides necessary sub-drainage. But all the standard pavements
are, or soon become, impermeable to water from the surface, and seepage
from the sub-foundation can be better taken care of by the sub-drainage specified
in Sect. 26, which should usually cost not more than five cents per square yard
of the pavement; and if drainage be required, these sub-drains should be used
even with the broken stone foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice of laying pavement surfaces, particularly those of asphalt, upon
a foundation of old stone blocks, carelessly reset, with the joints unfilled with
mortar, is all wrong and should never be resorted to. The integrity and durability
of an asphalt pavement depends largely upon the strength and rigidity of
its foundation; to lay an asphalt surface, however good, over such an old block
foundation, is an inexcusable waste of money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old stone block and cobble-stone pavements, that have become solidified in
place by long travel over them, make a good foundation for asphalt or other
pavements, provided they can be utilized without taking up or disturbing the
old pavement; but such cases occur so rarely that they have not been considered
in these specifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>A thoroughly consolidated old McAdam pavement, if not worn too thin, also
makes a very satisfactory pavement foundation if it can be used undisturbed, or
by simply trimming off the high points.</p>

<p class='c007'>Low places in old pavements, that are otherwise satisfactory for a foundation,
may be brought to the proper elevation with hydraulic concrete. “Binder”
material is usually specified for this purpose in foundations for asphalt pavements,
but hydraulic concrete is both better and cheaper.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. The specifications for Portland cement here given are practically those
adopted by the “American Society for Testing Materials.”</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Natural Cement.</strong> While these specifications uniformly refer to the use of
Portland cement, it is not intended to convey the idea that natural cement concrete
is not suitable for pavement foundations; on the contrary, it may be used with
entire confidence, as the experience in a large number of cities has proven beyond
question. Whether Portland or natural cement shall be used is usually a question
of relative cost. At the present very low prices of Portland cement in most
cities, more strength in pavement foundations can usually be obtained per
dollar expended for cement, from Portland than from natural cement. The
specifications for natural cement, as adopted by the American Society for
Testing Materials differ from those for Portland cement in the following
particulars:</p>

<p class='c007'>The <strong>specific gravity</strong> shall not be less than 2.8.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Fineness.</strong> The residue left on a No. 100 sieve shall not exceed 10 per cent.,
and on a No. 200 sieve shall not exceed 30 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Setting.</strong> It shall not begin to set in less than ten minutes, nor set hard in
less than thirty minutes; but shall set hard within three hours.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Soundness.</strong> Standard pats kept in air and in water should remain firm and
hard and show no signs of cracking or disintegration.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The frequent requirement that the fine material shall be screened out, is not
necessary or advisable. Experiments and experience have shown conclusively
that unless an unusual amount of fine material and “dust” be present, or unless
this fine material be allowed to separate and aggregate in masses by itself, the
resulting concrete is improved rather than deteriorated by its presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where there is an unusual excess of “dust” in the crushed stone, the quantity
of sand used in the concrete should be decreased accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Many specifications do not require this and in a number of cities where the
specifications do require it, contractors habitually neglect to comply. When
stone and sand are deposited directly upon the earth, it is very difficult to avoid
taking up earth and mud with the materials, particularly when the street is wet
and muddy. Lumps of soil and débris unquestionably injure the concrete. The
cost of providing a lumber floor is comparatively small, as the plank may be
used over and over again. Specifications should, therefore, contain this requirement
and it should be enforced.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. The ratios of the materials may appropriately be varied with the strength
and soundness of the sub-foundation, the amount of travel on the street, and
with the thickness of foundation it is proposed to use. Where good materials
are used and the work is properly done, a 1:3:5 concrete six inches thick is sufficient
for streets of the heaviest travel. For streets of light travel a 1:5:9 concrete
will usually give entirely satisfactory results. The most economical thickness
for a concrete foundation is an important consideration. The strength of concrete
may be said to increase, within usual limits of practice, with the ratio of
cement in it. The strength of concrete beams or slabs increases in the ratio of the
square of their depth. To secure a required amount of strength in a pavement
foundation, we may therefore vary the richness of the concrete and the depth
of the foundation so as to secure the requisite strength at the least total cost of
materials and labor. This will be influenced by the cost of materials and labor
in each particular locality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within certain workable limits there is no reason why the same principles of
proportioning the strength of a pavement foundation to the work required of it
should not be applied as are employed in designing other engineering structures.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practice, usual in many cities, of adopting general specifications requiring
a standard thickness of foundation and composition of concrete, and applying
these to all streets, regardless of the quantity and character of travel which
the pavement is expected to carry, is illogical and often very wasteful. If
such a standard foundation is sufficient for the streets of heaviest travel, it is
obviously a sheer waste of money to use it on the suburban streets carrying the
lightest travel. It is therefore better in preparing standard specifications for
pavement in any city to leave blanks for the ratios of the concrete and for the
thickness of the foundation, to be filled in, in each individual case, as the judgment
of the engineer may dictate.</p>

<p class='c007'>While it is important that the foundation of any pavement shall be adequate,
it is inexcusable to waste money in providing superfluous strength. For the
great majority of suburban streets, carrying but little except the local travel, a
foundation four inches thick made of good Portland cement concrete in the
ratios of 1:4:8 will prove entirely satisfactory. Hundreds of such streets paved
over a foundation of that thickness, made of natural cement concrete in the
ratios of 1:2:4 can be cited where the foundation has proved entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The character and firmness of the sub-foundation must, of course, be taken
into consideration in designing the foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. The routine here described produces better concrete with less expenditure of
labor, than the one often followed of putting all the dry materials on the concrete
board before any mixing is begun. The writer has proved this from actual
records covering a large quantity of work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. The objections to using mortar for plastering over the concrete are: that it
is more costly than concrete; that the two materials may, under certain conditions,
separate and the thin mortar surface break up under travel; that, if permitted,
the mortar may be used to cover up defective concrete, and that in the
case of asphalt pavements the pavement surface is more likely to “shift” on the
smooth surface of the mortar than on the rough surface of the concrete. The
practice of going over the fresh concrete with street brooms should not be permitted.
The only argument in favor of it is that it may be used to conceal
defective patches in the concrete.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. See foot-note<a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, p. <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>. The cost of filling the joints of old block pavement
with mortar or grout is considerable. It will hardly ever be less than 20 cents
and may exceed 35 cents per square yard, depending on the volume of joints
and the local cost of material and labor. The cost of resetting and ramming
the blocks with proper care will usually be from 10 cents to 12 cents per square
yard, so that the cost of the foundation, exclusive of the value of the blocks, may
vary from 30 cents to 47 cents per square yard.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a good concrete foundation 6 inches in depth can be laid for from 70 to 90
cents per square yard, it is obvious that if the old blocks can be sold for as much
as the difference between the cost of the old block and the concrete foundation,
nothing will be saved by using the old block foundation. In at least one city,
asphalt pavement has been extensively laid over old stone block foundation
relaid in a very careless manner, the joints being filled usually with the old sand
or loam found in the street. This practice cannot be too strongly condemned.
Asphalt pavement surfaces resting on such a foundation are necessarily short-lived
and unsatisfactory. The practice of opening the street to travel for a
period after the blocks are relaid and before the asphalt surface is applied, helps,
under favorable conditions, to consolidate the foundation, but does not remove
the objections to it. If heavy rains intervene, the sub-foundation becomes
saturated with water, and its resistance so reduced that the stone blocks settle
out of shape, particularly in soft spots, and they are usually hastily raised and
reset just before the asphalt surface is applied. The result is an insecure foundation
fatal to the durability and usefulness of the pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. Where there is a possibility that gravel may be used, the contractor should
be asked to name prices for the gravel foundation as well as the stone foundation,
since, unless this be done, the change from the one material to the other might
be held to be illegal.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. There has been much discussion as to the suitableness of these oil asphalts,
called “residual pitches,” for use in making asphalt pavements. When properly
prepared from suitable asphaltic oils, so as to comply with the specifications
here given, there can be no doubt that good pavements can be made with them.
But as they appear on the market, being usually produced at different localities
and refineries from crude oils of differing qualities, distilled by somewhat differing
methods, and usually at temperatures of from 900 degrees to 1200 degrees, they
are likely to vary so greatly in quality as to make their use inadvisable without
careful technical inspection. Unless, therefore, the engineer is prepared to make,
or to have such inspection made, it is hardly wise or safe to permit their use.
They stand, in this respect, upon a footing different from the better-known
natural asphalts obtained from large deposits of practically uniform character
and quality, where the simpler process of refining is less likely to effect injuriously
the chemical quality of the material.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be confidently predicted that any of these “residual pitches” which
comply with these specifications will, if properly handled, make a good
pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. The possibility that some of these compounds or artificial asphalts, may be
suitable for use in pavements is not denied. But in the absence of a fuller knowledge
of them than we now have, and in the light of present experience, the only
safe course is to reject them.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. It is not intended here to enter into an extended discussion of the fact that
some asphalts are injuriously affected by water, and the bearing which this fact
should have upon the selection of an asphalt for pavement purposes. There
can be no doubt that modern treatment and methods of construction have
tended to diminish but not wholly to prevent the disintegrating effect of water
upon pavements made with such asphalt, and if the engineer could be certain
that his pavements would be constructed by contractors guided by long experience
and the best expert advice, he might perhaps safely disregard this provision.
Since in practice he can have no such assurance, the provision is a wise
one and it does not involve any serious or material hardship to the contractor.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. It is now well recognized that the character and quality of the sand used
is one of the most important elements in determining the utility and durability
of an asphalt pavement. A satisfactory sand should be insisted on, even if it
involves a very considerable increase in the first cost of the work.</p>

<p class='c007'>While our knowledge of the subject is not complete, experience seems to
indicate pretty clearly that a sand of the quality and size-grading here specified
as typical, may be depended upon to produce a good pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. The use of Portland cement in surface mixtures to be laid on streets of
heavy travel, or those exposed to damp foundations, is very strongly recommended.
On streets of the heaviest travel, or where the pavement will be exposed
to unfavorable conditions of dampness, particularly if the pulverized stone
is not very finely ground, the Portland cement may constitute twenty per cent.
of the pulverized material, or “dust,” as it is commonly called. Ordinarily from
five to ten per cent. may be used to advantage on all streets of moderately heavy
travel.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. For determining the consistency of individual batches of asphalt paving
cement with a standard sample, the flow-plate method is most convenient and
sufficiently accurate. For a description of the latest improved form of this
apparatus see Engineering News of Aug. 22, 1912, p. 347. It can only be used,
however, where the cements to be compared are of the same general composition—the
same refined asphalt and tempering agent—as the standard.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. The practical value of the exact determination of the ductility of asphalt
paving cements is regarded by the author as not well established. It is customary,
however, in most recent specifications to require it. Some asphaltic
cements that have been quite successfully used for pavements have not complied
with such requirements, while good coal-tar pitches will greatly exceed them.
Where this test is used the usual specification requires that a briquette of
asphaltic cement having a cross-section of one square centimeter, at penetration
50, shall elongate to the extent of not less than 20 nor more than 85 centimeters
at 77° F. If the asphaltic cement varies from 50 penetration an increase or decrease
of at least 2 centimeters will be required for each five points above
or below 50 penetration (Dow apparatus to be used).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. It should be noted, in a general way, that there is quite a difference in the
temperature to which different asphalts may be safely subjected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trinidad asphalt, and the California residual pitches, will not be injured by
the higher range of temperatures named in these specifications, while Bermudez
and some other asphalts should be worked at as nearly as possible to the lower
range of temperatures named. The relative amount of loss of the different
asphalts when exposed for seven hours to the temperature of 325 degrees (Sect.
44) will supply a rough practical guide as to the temperature permissible—the
greater the loss, the closer should the lower range of temperatures be adhered to.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. The open base-course, or “binder,” composed only of crushed stone, coated
with pitch or asphaltic cement, extensively and almost exclusively used up to
a recent date, is no longer advocated by the best authorities on asphalt pavements.
The aim is now to make the base-course as dense and strong as the
surface-course.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. The importance of proper and thorough rolling is not usually fully appreciated,
and this part of the work is often shirked by the contractor. Not only
should the heavy roller be at work as soon as the material will bear it, but the
roller should, when work is progressing regularly, be kept at work all the time.
It is a safe motto that the final rolling cannot be overdone.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. There is still a wide difference of opinion as to the advisability of laying the
asphalt surface directly against the rail, many engineers preferring to set one
or more courses of paving brick, or stone paving blocks between the rail and
the edge of the asphalt. The writer’s experience is to the effect that, if the
work is properly done, the first-named form of construction is preferable. If
the asphalt be laid against a rail so cold that the asphalt material in contact
with or near the rail is chilled before it can be compressed, the work will necessarily
be unsatisfactory. As to durability, wheels following the line of the rail
or of the paving blocks will sooner or later form a rut in the asphalt which will
require repair—and there is not much difference in the results. The attempts
to prevent the formation of ruts by setting blocks alternately as headers and
stretchers is not always successful, even when the work is well done, and the
difficulty of properly compressing the tongues of asphalt between the headers
is so great that it is usually not well done. The asphalt settles under travel or
is gouged out, leaving a streak of rough pavement, and the difficulty and cost
of repairs is considerably increased. When paving blocks or bricks are used,
they should be firmly and carefully set in the concrete foundation. Probably
the most satisfactory construction of this kind consists of two or three lines
of the best paving brick set with their length parallel to the rail. It is somewhat
easier to get at and repair rail joints with this construction.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. The practice of laying asphalt block pavement upon crushed stone, or a
sand foundation, on streets carrying a considerable travel, is inadvisable. See

<p class='c007'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. Hard limestone may be used where trap is not procurable except at a prohibitive

<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. The pressure commonly specified is 5000 lbs per. square inch, but recent
investigations make it doubtful if that pressure is ever attained, or is, indeed,
practicable with any presses so far constructed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. Asphalt blocks are now very commonly laid upon their sides, even where they
are made as thin as two inches, on streets carrying very considerable travel.
The practice is not to be recommended unless the blocks are at least four inches
thick. Blocks two inches thick will give good service on private driveways
and streets of quite light travel.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Granite block pavement is, as a rule, used upon, and appropriate for streets
of the heaviest class of travel, and should, therefore, be provided with the best
and strongest foundation. It is nearly always poor economy to lay granite
blocks upon a broken stone, gravel, or sand foundation.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. Like other stones, granite from various localities differs widely in strength,
hardness and brittleness. Great hardness, accompanied with comparative
brittleness, is not desirable in granite for paving blocks. Such material
usually polishes by travel and becomes quite slippery, and it is likely to become
“turtle-backed,” that is, the corners are likely to be chipped off or worn off,
making the pavement very rough and uneven. The quality of the granite
to be used in any one city is generally determined by the available supply, and
specifications must be drawn with reference thereto.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. Except on streets of excessively heavy travel there seems to be no good
reason for making the blocks more than five inches deep. Blocks of this depth
are quite sure to become deformed by irregular wear before the pavement will
need to be renewed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. The widths of joints here specified as allowable are based upon the assumption
that they will be filled with Portland cement grout as specified in Sect. 75.
If this grout filling is used narrower joints are not necessary, as the grout has
sufficient strength to support the corners of the blocks, and sufficient hardness
to resist the wear of travel (largely protected as it is by the blocks themselves)
and to cause the blocks to wear down quite evenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many European cities the specifications require much closer joints. The
granite there available appears to break out naturally to truer lines and better
surfaces than that used in the Eastern states, at least, so that the cost of dressing
the blocks abroad is not as great as here.</p>

<p class='c007'>The City of New York has recently adopted specifications for “Special
Improved” Granite Block pavement intended to approximate the Liverpool
standard. These require that the blocks shall be not less than 6 nor more than
ten inches long, not less than 3½ nor more than 4½ inches wide and five
inches in depth. “The blocks are to be rectangular with tops and sides uniform
in thickness, to lay closely, and with fair and true surface, free from bunches
and so cut or dressed that when laid stone to stone the joints shall not exceed
⅜ of one inch. The head of the block shall be so cut that it shall not have
more than one-quarter of an inch depression from a straight-edge laid in any
direction across the head and held parallel to the general surface of the block.”
The joints are filled with bituminous cement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above specification is very difficult to meet from the granite available
to New York without excessive and expensive cutting, and examination of the
pavements laid under these specifications shows that the joints greatly exceed
the width specified.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is believed that equally good results may be secured by permitting somewhat
wider joints filled with grout, and the cost would be materially reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. The most satisfactory arrangement of courses at street intersections is that
shown by Fig. 14, page 208, Tillson’s Street Pavements and Paving Materials,
2d edition.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. The practice of filling the joints with gravel to a depth of one inch or more
before the blocks are rammed is of doubtful utility. If the blocks are set closely
against each other they will be well held in place while the ramming proceeds.
In practice it is hardly possible to closely gage the depth of such preliminary
gravel filling, and the top or final filling whether of grout or of gravel and bituminous
cement, is likely to vary greatly in depth, and the lateral support of the
blocks is thus likely to vary in strength and rigidity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. It has been the almost universal custom, in this country at least, to fill the
joints in granite paving either with gravel alone or with gravel and bituminous
cement. But the reasons that have led engineers to prefer grout filling
for brick pavements apply with equal force to granite pavement. It makes a
stronger and harder filling than the gravel and bituminous cement, and gives a
better support to the edges of the paving blocks, thus tending to prevent chipping
and “turtle-backing” in the pavement. It is also a materially cheaper filling
than the gravel and bituminous cement. But to provide for the expansion and
contraction of the pavement by changes of temperature, it is desirable that a
strip in the gutters, and an occasional strip across the whole street, shall be filled
with the more yielding material, as specified.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. The object of adding asphalt and Portland cement is to make the cement
stronger and less susceptible to changes of temperature. Pure coal-tar pitch
is very brittle at low temperatures, and is liable to flow from the crown of the
street to the gutters in hot summer weather. A cement made as here specified
is not only much stronger and less brittle in cold weather, but requires a materially
higher temperature to cause it to flow than does pure pitch.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. As the wheels of vehicles frequently follow along the lines of the rails, thus
concentrating their effect on a narrow strip near the rails, and as the continuous
joint against the rail makes the pavement weaker there, the mortar bed, and
the greater care in setting the blocks along and near the rail are advisable.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. If the joints are parallel to the direction of travel on the street the wheels of
vehicles are more likely to abrade or break off the corners of the stone and form
incipient ruts.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f40'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r40'>40</a>. These specifications conform in most particulars to those adopted by the
“Association for Standardizing Paving Specifications,” and are substantially
the same as those recommended by the “National Paving Brick Manufacturers’
Association” though they differ in some details from each. The latest specifications
adopted by the Association for Standardizing Paving Specifications are
very full and satisfactory and are to be highly commended.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f41'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r41'>41</a>. Here again a good concrete foundation is recommended, as being in the end
the most satisfactory and economical. See foot-note<a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, page <a href='#Page_23'>23</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. The Association for Standardizing Paving Specifications (New Orleans
meeting) adopted a standard size for paving bricks and blocks as follows: Paving
brick, 8½ inches long, 2½ inches wide and 4 inches in depth. Paving
blocks 8½ inches long, 3½ inches wide and 4 inches deep. There seems to
be no sufficient reason for confining the brick to these dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f43'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. The specifications of the Association for Standardizing Paving Specifications
require that all paving brick shall have lugs on one side, and allow a projection
of ¼ inch from the face of the brick. The object is to provide a wider joint between
the bricks in order to facilitate the filling of the joints. The author does
not believe these lugs necessary, nor that brick without lugs, but otherwise
acceptable, should be excluded. It is certain that many of the best brick pavements
ever constructed have been built of bricks without lugs. If lugs are
required they should preferably not project more than one-eighth inch. The
same reasons that make narrow joints desirable in other block pavements apply
equally to brick pavements.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. The A. S. P. S. Specifications permit a loss of 22% with the block size, but
do not name a permissible loss for “brick” size.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f45'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Absorption of less than one-half of one per cent., usually indicates that a shale
brick has been over-burned, resulting in increased brittleness.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. The absorption test is falling into disfavor, particularly with the manufacturers.

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f47'>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. <i>If the joints are to be filled with bituminous cement</i>, substitute for sections
90 and 91 the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>Directly after the completion of the rolling and ramming, all the joints in the
brick pavement and between it and the curbing, manholes or other structures,
shall be filled with a bituminous cement in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c007'>The bituminous cement shall be composed, by weight, of one hundred (100)
parts of straight-run coal-tar pitch commercially known as number four and
twenty (20) parts of refined Trinidad asphalt melted and thoroughly mixed together
at a temperature of about 350° F., to which shall be added twenty (20)
parts of dry Portland cement, which shall be thoroughly incorporated with the
hot bitumen until a homogeneous mass is produced, and kept agitated so as to
prevent settlement or separation until the cement is used. If another asphalt
is used instead of Trinidad the quantity added to the pitch must be sufficient
so that the cement will not flow at a temperature lower than one hundred and
twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit (125° F.). This cement while at a temperature
of about 325 degrees F. shall then be poured from a spouted vessel into all joints
and vacancies in the pavement until they are completely filled, repouring being
resorted to if necessary to accomplish the complete filling of the joints. After
the joints are thus filled a layer of sand one-half inch thick will be spread over
the whole surface of the pavement and allowed to remain until the engineer shall
direct its removal.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r50'>50</a>. The bituminous-cement joints are principally for the purpose of providing
for the expansion of the pavement in very hot weather.</p>

<p class='c007'>Experience seems to have proved that cement grout is, everything considered,
the best and cheapest filling for the joints in brick pavement. If the filling is
properly done, the edges of the brick are supported and the corners do not chip
off. With the expansion joints provided at intervals by the bituminous-filled
joints, the curbs will not be forced out of line, nor will the pavement be raised
from its sand bed by expansion, causing the rumbling sound sometimes noticed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where grout filling is used there seems to be no necessity for covering the surface
of the pavement with sand, as is usually done, provided the grout is kept damp.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. Since immunity from early natural decay is secured by preservative treatment,
the important requisite for wood paving blocks is capacity to withstand
the wear and tear of the travel on the street. We have as yet no very satisfactory
data as to the ability of the various species of wood to endure the somewhat
peculiar and special duty to which paving blocks are subjected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The test which seems to most nearly approach to what is wanted is that of
crushing strength, when the force is applied to the end of the sample, parallel
to its fibers; but this does not embrace the effect of impact to which paving
blocks are subjected under street travel. Whether this may be considered a
function of the end-crushing strength or not is an open question, though there
seems good reason to believe that it will prove to be so; and if so, there is no
good reason why woods of substantially equal strength under the end-crushing
test should not show about the same endurance under street travel, independent
of the element of natural durability, which is practically eliminated by preservative
treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The end-crushing strength per square inch of some of the kinds of timber named
as acceptable is about as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>It was formerly very customary to specify that only Southern long-leaved
yellow pine might be used for paving blocks, though this requirement was
seldom strictly enforced. The fact is, that with the exception of the test based
upon the number of growth rings per inch, it requires an expert knowledge,
acquired only by long experience, to distinguish with certainty the species of
Southern pine from the appearance of the lumber alone. It is now almost
impossible to obtain in the market shipments of strictly long-leaved yellow pine,
and while that wood is undoubtedly superior to the other pine timbers for paving
blocks it seems useless to specify its exclusive use, or to propose specifications
designed to exclude lumber made from other species of pine. It was doubtless
the recognition of this situation that influenced the Association for Standardizing
Paving Specifications, at its last (New Orleans) convention to adopt a specification which practically admits everything known in the market as “Southern
yellow pine” having annual growth rings averaging less than eight to the inch
and excluding all timber having less than six rings to the inch. Within these
limits these specifications practically admit all pine lumber shipped from Southern
mills.</p>

<p class='c007'>The specifications here proposed, by limiting the number of growth rings to
nine per inch, would not confine the lumber to true long-leaved yellow pine, but
would secure a more mature and solid quality of lumber. It is true, however,
that both these specifications and those adopted by the A. S. P. C. exclude most
“Cuban pine” lumber which is very rapid growing, the growth rings often numbering
but three or four to the inch, though the strength of the wood from this
species indicates that it may safely be used for pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. The question of the most economical depth for wood paving blocks is as yet
unsettled. In New York City, blocks 3½ inches in depth are adopted as the
standard and are being used on streets of the heaviest travel, the practice of
Berlin, Paris and other foreign cities being thus followed. The arguments in
favor of these short blocks are lower first cost, and that, with much deeper blocks,
the usual uneven wear of a wood pavement will make it so rough as to require
removal before the blocks are worn down so as to be split up and dislodged from
their places. While reliable data on these points are wanting, it seems to the
writer very unwise to use such short blocks on streets of heavy travel, and he
would recommend that the minimum length for use on such streets be 4½
inches, and he would prefer 5 inches.</p>

<p class='c007'>On streets of light travel a length of 3½ inches should be satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Recent observations on heavy travelled streets in New York indicate that when
long-leaved yellow pine blocks become worn down to a remaining depth of about
2⅛ inches they split up into fine slivers and the pavement goes to pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. Most of the more recent specifications require the use of a heavy oil, said to
be composed of creosote oil with an admixture of refined tar, on the ground that
the tar is necessary as a water-proofing agent to prevent the creosote oil from
being dissolved out by water or evaporated into the air. It is claimed that if
moisture can thus be excluded from entering the wood, decay will be prevented,
even in the absence of the antiseptic elements of creosote oil. It is not intended
to discuss this matter at length here. We know from long experience that
genuine creosote oil is the best preservative of wood so far found; also that creosoted
piles have stood in tidal waters, alternately exposed to water and air, for
twenty-five years and still retain sufficient creosote oil to resist the Teredo—a
very severe test. Why experiment with a comparatively untried material,
particularly when it costs as much as the genuine creosote oil, is rather more
difficult to force into the wood, and has some admitted objectionable qualities?</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f54'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r54'>54</a>. It is a common practice of contractors in some cities, in the laying of both
wood-block and asphalt block pavement, where a mortar bed is called for, to
substitute a bed of mixed sand and cement, dampened only to such a degree as
will make the mass pulverulent like damp sand, the claim being made that ordinary
mortar cannot be spread and gaged properly. This claim is unfounded.
The objection to the practice is that the dampened mixture does not contain
sufficient water to cause the cement to set, and with the practically water-tight
paving surface, does not receive, even in rainy weather, the necessary amount of
water. If the weather be dry, the small quantity of moisture in the mixture
quickly evaporates, leaving the so-called mortar bed not much better than a
layer of sand alone. The writer has found such alleged mortar dry and unset
two weeks after the pavement had been completed. If real mortar is not to be
used, a layer of sand might almost as well be substituted at first.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f55'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r55'>55</a>. In a number of cities the specifications require the joints in wood-block pavement
to be filled with Portland cement grout. If the blocks are set as closely
together as they should be, the joints will be so narrow that no grout, thick enough
in consistency to be of value, will enter them, except for a short distance down
from the top, the remaining depth of the joints remaining unfilled. An examination
of any well-laid wood-block pavement soon after it has been attempted to
fill the joints with grout will verify this statement. Furthermore, the oil which
exudes from the blocks, acting on the thin films of grout, seems to deteriorate
the mortar and to render it practically inert. On the contrary, fine
dry sand will readily run into and completely fill the joints, and under travel
the joints will soon become impervious to water. The sand filling is therefore
regarded as better, and it costs less than the grout filling.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f56'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. Wherever an old pavement or macadam road can be utilized it makes an
excellent foundation for a pavement of this kind, provided it is not in too dilapidated
a condition, extends from curb to curb, and its surface conforms near
enough to the desired street surface so that the necessary changes and repairs
will not be too expensive. Where the new pavement is expected to carry quite
a heavy travel it is not advisable to use plain crushed stone for filling depressions
and leveling up the surface. It is difficult, even where proper care is used, to
make such patches of broken stone as firm and strong as the adjoining old pavement,
which is a necessary condition to secure satisfactory results; for if the
masses of broken stone yield under travel, slight depressions will form over
them in the bituminous surface, which will in time become holes requiring
repairs. The 1:4:9 concrete specified for this work is not very much more
expensive than plain broken stone, it will not shift or break up under travel,
and will in the end prove a better investment.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f57'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. Where a new foundation is required broken stone or macadam is most frequently
used for bituminous concrete pavements. Unless such foundations are
constructed in the same way and with about the same care as is necessary for
a macadam road it is liable to prove unsatisfactory. Under the very heavy
wheel loads that may occasionally pass over the streets, imperfectly compacted
broken stone is likely to shift sufficiently to start incipient ruts which will enlarge
and in time necessitate expensive repairs. Such conditions are frequently seen
on bituminous concrete pavements subjected to heavy travel. These pavements,
like sheet asphalt pavements, require a foundation that will be absolutely
unyielding under travel. For this reason a concrete foundation will generally
be found more economical in the long run than a broken stone foundation. The
increased first cost per square yard is not very great and this additional money
will in most cases prove a good investment. At the usual prices of material and
labor a square yard of 4 inch concrete should cost about 50 cents, while a properly
constructed broken stone foundation 6 inches thick (which would not nearly
equal in strength and rigidity 4 inches of concrete) would cost about 45 cents
per square yard. Considering the much greater durability and lower cost of
repairs of the pavement on the concrete foundation, this small additional cost
is not worth consideration. While the specifications are made to cover the three
kinds of foundation, it is assumed that the kind of foundation to be used will
be decided in advance, and that the part of these specifications relating to the
others kinds of foundation will, in actual use be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. A bituminous cement composed largely of coal-tar pitch has heretofore been
most used in pavements of this character. It is not denied that very good
pavements have been, and can be built with this material, but the superiority
of the asphaltic cement here specified is so great that it is true economy to use it.
The difference in cost at prevailing prices of material will be ten to twelve cents
per square yard. The greater durability and serviceability of the pavement
made with the asphaltic cement will, particularly on streets of comparatively
heavy travel, far more than justify this additional cost.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. Hydraulic concrete pavement is to be recommended only for country roadways
and for city streets of very moderate travel. While our experience with
this kind of pavement is yet limited there is reason to believe from the nature
of the material that it will not prove to be a satisfactory or economical pavement
for streets of heavy travel. But in all cities and towns there are many residence
streets where the travel is very light, and yet where a permanent pavement
is wanted and warranted. For these, it is believed that a properly constructed
concrete pavement will prove very satisfactory and durable, and the low cost
at which it can be constructed should make it very attractive to city officials and
property owners. The author has advocated its use under such conditions
for many years (see Engineering News, July 21st, 1904). Like other composite
pavements its utility and durability will depend largely upon the good quality
of the materials used and the skill and thoroughness with which the work is
done.</p>

<p class='c007'>The specifications here offered are the result of the observation and experience
of the author, and it is believed that pavements laid in accordance with them will
give very satisfactory results.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. A number of engineers advocate the construction of concrete pavement in
one homogeneous course, and quite a number of pavements have been constructed
in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like any other composite pavement, it is called upon to perform two functions;
to safely sustain the weight of loads passing over it, and to resist wear and
abrasion of its surface. A material and form of construction that meets the
first requirement may not meet the second. Experience has proved that ordinary
1:3:6 concrete makes an entirely satisfactory foundation for any pavement,
but it lacks the hardness and strength to successfully resist the surface
abrasion of travel. To secure this quality a richer and harder concrete is called
for, but it is unnecessary that the foundation should be equally hard. To
construct the pavement in two courses as here specified would seem to be the
logical way, especially as it decreases the total cost, and should make a more
durable pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. Some engineers advocate a greater total thickness of the pavement than is
here specified (6 inches). Considering that this pavement should never be used
on heavy traveled streets, a total thickness of concrete of six inches will have
ample strength to carry the loads to which it will be subjected. If so, it is a
useless waste of money to increase the thickness of the concrete.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. The use of limestone for the top course (unless it is of very superior quality)
is not advisable or economical unless the cost of trap rock is so high as to be
prohibitive, which, considering its superior durability under the wear of travel,
will not often be the case.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f63'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r63'>63</a>. It is advisable to remove the screenings from this surface mixture for two
reasons: first, to secure greater uniformity of composition. If the screenings
are allowed to remain in the aggregate, there is danger of segregation into patches
of different sized aggregate and different ratios of materials, which it is very
important to avoid, and second, the small fragments of stone are more likely
to be crushed under the concentrated weight of wheels than the larger masses,
and to thus start disintegration. Lack of uniformity in the composition and
homogeneity in this surface-course concrete is especially to be guarded against,
otherwise the surface of the pavement will wear unevenly and depressions and
ruts are likely to result.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f64'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r64'>64</a>. The ideal composition of this surface-course concrete is one where the stone
forms the largest possible part of the mass consistent with sufficient mortar to fill
the voids and thoroughly bind the fragments of stone together.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f65'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r65'>65</a>. The importance of securing high quality and great uniformity in the surface
course cannot be urged too strongly.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f66'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r66'>66</a>. This requirement must be strictly enforced. Otherwise there will be danger
that the two courses may not properly adhere to each other. It is the writer’s
experience that if this rule is observed there will be no danger of the two courses
separating.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f67'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r67'>67</a>. The purpose of this rolling is mainly to evenly compress the mass and thus
secure its uniform density. It also produces a truer surface than can usually
be secured by ramming alone.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f68'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r68'>68</a>. Among engineers there is quite a wide difference of opinion as to the proper
spacing of expansion joints, and, in fact, as to the necessity or advisability of
providing them at all. It has been suggested that it might be better to omit
them entirely, allowing the pavement to form its own expansion joints by cracking
along lines where natural forces dictate. Such cracks by their irregularity give
a bad appearance to the surface, but observation seems to indicate that the edges
of these natural joints wear as well as those made by expansion joints. Further
observation and experience is needed in the matter. In most concrete it is
known that some contraction takes place during the setting of the cement,
regardless of temperature changes, and cracking is probably due as much to
this permanent contraction as to that caused by low temperature. The coefficient
of expansion of concrete by heat is variable but so small that expansion
joints ⅛ inch wide every fifty feet along the street should provide for
temperature changes.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f69'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. If the expansion joints are not thus filled with bituminous cement they will
become filled and packed with incompressible stone, sand, etc., that will not
permit expansion.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. The practical value of oiling concrete pavements has not yet been determined
by sufficient experience. There is reason, however, to believe that the slight
coating of bitumen will materially preserve the surface from abrasion and that
its benefit will thus be greater than its cost. It will also tend to prevent the very
slight dust that might otherwise exist on the pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f71'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. In this class of pavements the contractor or promoter may properly be
required to assume responsibility for the character and utility of the work produced,
and the municipal authorities should assume no part of such responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. Upon the general subject of time guarantees of municipal work, see Chapter
XI, “Municipal Public Works,” by the author.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. Concrete combined curb and gutter is suitable for use on the great majority
of residence streets, and others where the travel is not excessive, or where it
will not be subjected to specially severe use, as on business streets where heavy
vehicles are likely to be often backed against the curb. If properly constructed
it will have sufficient hardness and strength to withstand all ordinary usage; it
makes a better appearance, particularly on residence streets, than any other
kind of curbing, is durable, and is usually less expensive than any other suitable,
equally durable and equally well-finished curbing of natural stone, since the
gutter displaces an equal area of pavement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r74'>74</a>. The sketch here presented conforms pretty closely to usual practice except
in the width of the gutter. It is not uncommon to make the gutter from two
to three feet wide. This is not necessary or desirable. A width of 15 to 18
inches forms a sufficient gutter to carry away all drainage except during very
heavy rainfalls. Where the gutter projects out into the street sufficiently far
to be exposed to large numbers of heavily loaded wheels the outer corner is
likely to become broken off or unduly abraded.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f75'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. Curbing of all kinds is more likely to be injured by freezing and the
heaving of frost under and around it than from any other cause. Good drainage
is the best protection against such injury. It is important that these drains
shall be connected with sewers, drains or other outlets, so that water will not
stand in them.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f76'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r76'>76</a>. The most notable departure of these specifications from usual practice is
the use of a solid body of rich, homogeneous concrete for the whole section of the
structure, thus avoiding the use of two courses and qualities of concrete—the
core concrete and the facing. The most common cause of failure of concrete
curbs and gutters is the separation, more or less, of the facing from the core
concrete. Without doubt this can be prevented by the use of proper materials,
careful work, and the strict observance of the rule that the facing course must
be applied before the core concrete has begun to set. But it is difficult to always
secure these favorable conditions. Computation will show that the difference
in cost of materials, between the usual two-course construction and a single
body of rich concrete throughout, is not very great, while the saving in cost of
labor is so considerable as to make the actual difference in cost of the two types
very small. There can be no doubt that the simpler construction and the consequent
greater certainty of securing a durable and satisfactory job is greatly
in favor of the construction here recommended.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f77'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r77'>77</a>. The appearance of “hair cracks” on the surface of rich concrete, finished by
troweling, and the blotched appearance of the surface of concrete curbing, are
usually caused by improper finishing. The glazed surface produced by troweling,
particularly where pure, dry cement or neat mortar is applied is almost
sure to develop hair cracks, and the varying texture of the surface is likely to
absorb water unevenly and thus produce, in time, the unevenly colored or
blotched surface so often seen.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f78'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r78'>78</a>. The utility and durability of hydraulic concrete sidewalks depends largely
on the quality of materials and workmanship employed in the work. Too
frequently, specifications for this work are not sufficiently full, or not prepared
with the requisite care, or the work is not properly supervised or inspected
while in progress. The aggregate importance and cost of this sidewalk work
in our cities warrants more care and attention than it generally receives.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f79'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r79'>79</a>. Determined by the thickness of the drainage course adopted.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f80'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r80'>80</a>. It is customary in many cities to require that the drainage course under the
concrete shall have a depth of twelve or more inches. This deep-drainage is
designed to prevent the heaving of the sidewalk by freezing. Experience seems
to prove that this is not necessary, particularly if tile drains are provided to carry
off the water from the drainage course, as specified. Comparatively dry material,
even earth, does not heave with freezing; on the other hand, if the material and
the trench in which it is placed is wholly or partly filled with water, heaving is
liable to occur in severe freezing weather, whatever the depth of the drainage
course. Experience has proven, however, that four inches of drainage material
is sufficient if the water is drained out of it, while if allowed to stand saturated
with water, deeper drainage will give little if any better results. Where the soil
is sandy or the natural drainage is otherwise good, no drainage course is necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f81'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r81'>81</a>. Except in the matter of low first cost cinders are not desirable for the drainage
course. In time, this material is likely to slack, or decompose, and shrink in
volume more or less and to allow the sidewalk to settle. The hollow sound one
often notices when walking over a sidewalk and the cracks that frequently appear,
are usually caused by the irregular settlement of the drainage course. The object
of wetting down the cinders several days before they are used is to cause as much
as possible of this slacking to take place before the cinders are used in the
drainage course.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f82'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r82'>82</a>. There is a good deal of diversity of practice in the thickness of the concrete
to be used. For all ordinary sidewalks three inches of bottom course and one
inch of surface-course are ample, and in many cases the thickness of the surface
course has been reduced to one-half inch with satisfactory results. Three-fourths
inch of surface-course, if fairly uniform in thickness and of good quality,
will generally be ample for ordinary sidewalks.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f83'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r83'>83</a>. It is customary to make the surface-course concrete much richer than this,
but it is not necessary if the materials are good and the work well done.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f84'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r84'>84</a>. This requirement is very important and should be strictly enforced, otherwise
there is danger that by the action of water, frost, and time, the two courses
may separate and the surface-course break up—a condition not infrequently
observed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f85'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r85'>85</a>. The troweling not only helps to secure a true surface, but tends to produce a
dense surface on the concrete; but it is not desirable that this surface shall be
smooth and glassy, hence the slight roughening of the surface with a wire brush.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f86'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. Care must be taken to make and leave these expansion joints open to their
full width entirely through the concrete. The practice of forming these expansion
joints by partitions of iron plate, against which the blocks of sidewalk are
built is not advised, for the reason that they are likely to prevent the thorough
compression of the concrete surface against or near the plates.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
